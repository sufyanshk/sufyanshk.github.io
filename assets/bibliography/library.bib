abstract = {Alloying W with Re is an effective method for improving its intrinsic ductility. The solubility limit of Re in W is ∼ 27{\%} at 851 K. However, this alloy possesses a high enthalpy of formation, which can result in phase-instability. Configurational entropy alone cannot stabilize this alloy as a single-phase solid solution. Recent research questions the importance of configurational entropy in determining the single-phase stability of “complex, concentrated solid solutions” and suggests that vibrational entropy may play a critical role. The question arises: Can vibrational entropy contribute significantly enough to ensure single-phase stability in a binary alloy? Our first-principles phonon calculations using density functional theory demonstrate that vibrational entropy is equally essential as the configurational entropy in promoting the formation of a single-phase solid solution in WRe binary alloys. This finding necessitates revisiting the role of vibrational entropy in the single-phase stability of binary alloys.},

abstract = {Refractory metals and their alloys are promising, as they possess high-temperature strength and melting points at elevated temperatures. But the fundamental limitation associated with these metals is high-temperature oxidation. The literature mentions that the Ti, Zr, and Hf dissolve oxygen atoms up to 33 at.%, 29 at.%, and 20 at.% respectively, in the octahedral interstitial site of the HCP metal system. This has led to investigations on understanding the behavior of oxygen in an octahedral interstitial site just after penetrating in refractory metals and alloys. In the present work, the first principle DFT calculations were done to report the oxygen interstitial formation energy (OIFE) of 9 refractory metals, such as Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and Re, and 25 equiatomic BCC binary alloy systems, such as V-Ti, Nb-Ti, Ta-Ti, Mo-Ti, W-Ti, Nb-Zr, Ta-Zr, Mo-Zr, Nb-Hf, Ta-Hf, Mo-Hf, W-Hf, Nb-V, Ta-V, Mo-V, W-V, Mo-Nb, W-Nb, Re-Nb, Nb-Ta, Mo-Ta, W-Ta, W-Mo, Re-Mo, and W-Re. The OIFE for an alloy system was reported for 7 different octahedral sites, such as 0-6, 1-5, 2-4, 3-3, 4-2, 5-1, and 6-0, based on the number of atoms of A-type and B-type around oxygen interstitial as an octahedral nearest neighbor(octa-NN). The variation in OIFE with change in the atoms of A-type and B-type at the third nearest neighbors (3NN) was also checked for 0-6 and 6-0 sites, and it was observed that the contribution of atoms at 3NN was minimal. The OIFE decreases with an increase in the number of atoms of B-type around the oxygen interstitial as octa-NN, following the trend of composition averaged OIFE calculated from OIFE of individual elements. In most of the cases, the OIFE of 0-6 site was minimum when the O interstitial was surrounded by all the atoms of B-type, which have low OIE in their pure bulk form, and the OIE of 6-0 site was maximum when the O interstitial was surrounded by all the atoms of A-type, which have relatively higher OIE in their pure bulk form when compared to atoms of B-type. It is not the composition averaged OIFE that determines the stability of oxygen interstitial in alloys, but it is the presence of low OIFE elements as clusters around octahedral neighbor locally that determines it. It is because, the contributions to OIFE comes from octa-NN and the contributions from 3NN is relatively minimal. The presence of low OIFE element around oxygen interstitial at octa-NN and slightly in 3NN would make the oxygen behave as if it were in the bulk of low OIFE element, making the system prone to oxidation.},

abstract = {Valence electron concentration (VEC), atomic size difference ($\delta$), and Pugh's ratio (B/G) are a few of the empirical parameters widely used to design ductile refractory alloys. Here, we used the intrinsic ductility parameter (D), which is the ratio of surface energy ($\gamma$s) and unstable stacking fault energy ($\gamma$usfe), to design ductile refractory alloy. We found that the D correctly captures the experimentally observed ductility in concentrated refractory alloys. Here, we studied the enthalpy of formation ($\Delta$Ef), lattice distortion, and D of 9 refractory metals and 36 equiatomic refractory alloys using density functional theory simulations. We found that the $\Delta$Ef strongly influences the D of concentrated refractory alloys. The positive $\Delta$Ef and $\delta$ lead to large lattice distortion in concentrated refractory alloys. However, we did not find a strong correlation between lattice distortion and D in the presently studied alloys. We found that the success of VEC and Pugh's ratio in designing ductile refractory alloys has a strong dependence on the underlying $\Delta$Ef of the alloy. We have developed a bottom-up method, which drastically reduces the number of alloys to be studied, to design ductile concentrated refractory alloys that can be thermodynamically stable.},

	abstract = {Developing ductile refractory alloys have remained a challenge. Decreasing the valence electron concentration of refractory alloys has been widely suggested for improving their ductility. However, Re has been used to ductilize W, which goes against the low valency suggestion. The thermodynamic stability of refractory alloys has never been considered while suggesting alloying elements to improve ductility. Here we use first-principles density functional theory simulations to unravel the role of enthalpy of formation in improving the intrinsic ductility of refractory alloys. The intrinsic ductility is assessed using the D-parameter, which is the ratio of surface energy and unstable stacking fault energy. We studied 25 equiatomic binary refractory alloys and found that positive enthalpy of formation improves ductility. The small positive enthalpy of formation could be compensated by sufficiently large entropy; hence the alloy is expected to be a single phase. Our present work explains the role of high-valency and low-valency alloying elements in improving the ductility of refractory alloys. These findings provide a path to design thermodynamically stable and intrinsically ductile high-temperature alloys.},

abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) are multicomponent alloys in equiatomic or nearly equiatomic composition. Anticipated sluggish atomic diffusion is reported to be one of the core effects in HEAs which is presumably responsible for their many unique properties. For the first time, in the present study, tracer (Ni) diffusion in CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi alloys is measured by the radiotracer technique in the temperature range of 1073–1373 K using the63Ni isotope. Chemically homogeneous alloys of equiatomic composition were prepared by a vacuum arc melting route. The microstructure and phase stability of the alloys in the given temperature range is confirmed by differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. Ni diffusion in both CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi alloys is found to follow Arrhenius behavior. When plotted against the homologous temperature, a tendency to a successive slow down of the tracer diffusion rate with an increased number of components in equiatomic alloys is unambiguously established. Both the entropy term as well as the energy barriers is revealed to contribute to this trend. The current results indicate that diffusion in HEAs cannot a priori be considered as sluggish.},

abstract = {We investigate phase stability in all binary alloys comprised of elements from groups 4 (Ti, Zr, Hf), 5 (V, Nb, Ta) and 6 (Cr, Mo, W) of the periodic table. First-principles calculations of the energy landscapes along crystallographic pathways that connect bcc to hcp and bcc to $\omega$ show that group 4 elements are very distinct from group 5 and 6 elements. While group 5 and 6 elements are stable in bcc, group 4 elements favor hcp and $\omega$ and are predicted to be dynamically unstable in bcc. A comprehensive first-principles investigation of the 36 refractory binary systems using statistical mechanics techniques reveals six distinct classes of alloys, each with a unique phase diagram topology. The predictions of this study are in excellent agreement with previous experimental work. One exception is a class of refractory alloys with high temperature miscibility gaps that are not predicted with the methods used in this work. Our calculations predict the stability of a low-temperature Laves phase in the Nb-V binary that has yet to be observed experimentally. The relationships between alloy chemistry and high-temperature phase stability revealed in this study provide a basis for the systematic design of multicomponent disordered refractory alloys.},

abstract = {A sufficient level of toughness at low temperatures is paramount for the use of structural steels intended for arctic applications. Therefore, it is important for the steel industry to identify the factors that control brittle fracture toughness. In this study, the quantitative effect of microstructure on the impact toughness transition temperature has been investigated with 18 different thermomechanically rolled and direct-quenched low-carbon ultra-high-strength steels with varying martensite and bainite contents. The steels were produced by altering their chemical composition, the finish rolling temperature and the total reduction of the prior austenite grains in the non-recrystallisation temperature regime, i.e. austenite pancaking, and characterised in terms of microstructural constituents, grain size distributions and texture as well as by using Charpy-V impact and tensile testing. It is shown for the first time that the impact toughness transition temperatures T28J and T50 closely follow a dynamic reference toughness, defined by yield strength and the size of the coarsest grains in the effective grain size distribution at 80th percentile. Decreasing the area fraction of {\{}100{\}} cleavage planes oriented within 15° of the macroscopic fracture plane by increasing austenite pancaking is also shown to improve T28J. The best toughness is achieved with the lowest finish rolling temperatures that are nevertheless high enough to avoid the subsequent formation of granular bainite, which weakens both the toughness and strength. The results show that it is perfectly possible to produce untempered ultra-high-strength martensitic and martensitic-bainitic structural steels with adequate low-temperature toughness when the grain size is properly controlled.},

abstract = {Phase decomposition influences significantly the mechanical properties of high entropy alloys (HEAs). Prediction of the phase decomposition of HEA is greatly hindered by the hyper-dimensional composition space of the alloys. In the present work, we propose to represent the HEAs as various pseudo-binary alloys of which the temperature dependent free energies as functions of compositions may be readily calculated by using first-principles methods in combination with thermodynamic models. With the calculated free energies, the phase diagrams of the pseudo-binary alloys may be constructed and the phase decomposition can be predicted. This procedure is applied to Hf-Nb-Ta-Ti-Zr alloy with body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. We predict that the equiatomic HfNbTaTiZr HEA suffers from phase decomposition below critical temperature of 1298 K. The HEA decomposes most favorably to BCC NbTa-rich and HfZr-rich phases. The BCC HfZr-rich phase transfers to a hexagonal close-packed structure (HCP) phase at low temperature. The predicted compositions of the decomposed phases are in good agreement with experiment and Thermal-Calc modeling. Furthermore, the effect of the phase decomposition on the strength of the HEA is evaluated by considering the solid-solution and precipitation strengthening mechanisms. The precipitation strengthening effect is stronger than the solid-solution strengthening at the low annealing temperature but becomes weaker at high annealing temperature.},

Experiments were first conducted with specially developed temperature probes to determine heat-transfer coefficients and recovery temperature at various stations in the freejet. Tests of the models were then carried out at appropriate stations in the freejet to produce tip temperatures in the range 3200-3900°F to simulate temperatures such as would be encountered in flight at velocities up to 7800 fps at altitudes near 70,000 ft. Successful performance was obtained with several models having 0.03-in. or smaller radii with little or no erosion occurring during runs of 13 sec duration. The best results were obtained with solid models of a ductile metallic alloy of hafnium-20{\%} tantalum and with coatings of this alloy on a graphite or tantalum-10{\%} tungsten alloy substrate. Several brittle materials, such as metallic carbides and boron nitride, showed good erosion resistance, but fracture was frequently encountered due to the unusually severe thermal shock associated with the test. The results indicate that the materials may be serviceable at similar velocities and altitudes near sea level. {\textcopyright} 1968 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have the potential to be a paradigm-shift for rational catalyst discovery but this new type of alloy requires a completely new approach to predict the surface reactivity. In addition to the ligand effect perturbing the surface-adsorbate bond, the random configuration of elements in the surface will also induce local strain effects due to the varying radii of neighboring atoms. Accurate modelling of HEA surface reactivity requires an estimate of this effect: To what degree is the adsorption of intermediates on these lattice distorted atomic environments affected by local strain? In this study, more than 3,500 density functional theory (DFT) calculated adsorption energies of *OH and *O adsorbed on the HEAs IrPdPtRhRu and AgAuCuPdPt are statistically analyzed with respect to the lattice constants of the alloys and the surfaces of each individual binding site. It is found that the inherent distortion of the lattice structure in HEAs releases the local strain effect on the adsorption energy as the atomic environment surrounding the binding atom(s) settles into a relaxed structure. This is even observed to be true for clusters of atoms of which the sizes deviate significantly from the atomic environment in which they are embedded. This elucidates an important aspect of binding site interaction with the neighboring atoms and thus constitutes a step towards a more accurate theoretical model of estimating the reactivity of HEA surfaces.

The segregation strength relative to the mixing enthalpy of a binary system determines the propensity for segregation stabilization. This relationship has been codified for the design space of positive enthalpy alloys; unfortunately, quantitative values for the grain boundary segregation enthalpy exist in only very few material systems, hampering the prospect of nanocrystalline alloy design. Here we present a Miedema-type model for estimation of grain boundary segregation enthalpy, with which potential nanocrystalline phase-forming alloys can be rapidly screened.

abstract = {To obtain higher comprehensive mechanical properties while avoid the adverse effects of Re element on the microstructure and economy of the alloy, a Re-free nickel-based single crystal superalloy is developed based on the Rene N5 single crystal superalloy. The microstructure evolution, compression properties, tensile properties, deformation mechanism and fracture behaviour of the self-designed alloy are investigated. The experimental results show that after the complete heat treatment, cuboidal precipitates with high degree of regular morphology are formed. The size of precipitates is about 0.49, and the volume fraction is approximately 61{\%}, which are better than those for a conventional second generation single crystal superalloy. The alloy reaches its maximum compressive and tensile strength at 760 ◦C and shows excellent microstructure thermal stability and improved mechanical properties. The alloy has an obvious strain hardening stage when the temperature is lower than 760 ◦C, while the softening stage is not obvious. When the temperature reaches 850 ◦C, the stress-strain curve of the sample mainly shows that the variable stress increases abruptly at the beginning and then decreases immediately. The tensile fracture of a single crystal at medium and low temperature is characterized by a slip fracture with a certain plastic deformation. A high temperature tensile fracture is characterized by typical plastic deformation, and its mechanism is a creep fracture with a uniform deformation.},

abstract = {The strengthening of metals by a variety of means has been of interest over much of history. However, the elucidation of the actual mechanisms involved in the processes of alloying and work hardening, and related processes of metals as a scientific pursuit, has become possible only through the parallel developments in dislocation theory and in definitive experimental tools such as electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The important developments over the past several decades in the mechanistic understanding of the often complex processes of interaction of dislocations with each other, with solute atoms, and with precipitates during plastic flow have largely remained scattered in the professional literature. The central processes of strengthening that are presented in this book are modeled by dislocation mechanics in detail, and the results are compared extensively with the best available experimental information. The book presents 509 references to principal authors on the subject over the past sixty-five years. The form of the coverage is intended to inspire readers to develop their own models of similar or related phenomena and, finally, engage in more advanced computational simulations, guided by the book.},

Atomistic modeling shows that both systems, known experimentally to consist of two solid solutions, evolve in different ways forming what could be describe as domains (regions of the solid solution with specific mixes of the participating elements). The computational modeling scheme used, based on the BFS method for alloys for the energetics, results on specific ‘critical' concentrations of the fifth element (either Al or V) for which they can be considered high entropy alloys. The algorithm presented provides a tool that could be helpful when determining the concentrations of the multiple elements needed in order to meet the requirements of a high entropy alloy, thus avoiding or minimizing the extensive experimental work needed to reach that conclusion.},

abstract = {Transition metals (TMs) are extensively used to improve the mechanical properties of niobium based alloy, one of the most promising high-temperature materials. Yet the microscopic mechanism of the alloying effects of these transition metals on the mechanical properties is unclear. In this study, we have mapped out the composition-SFE-ductility relationship for TM-alloyed Nb systems by comprehensively investigating the unstable stacking fault energies (SFEs), $\gamma$us, and the ductility in binary and ternary Nb alloys using the first-principles calculations. It is found that the valence electron concentration can be used as the key descriptor to evaluate the SFE of Nb matrix, which is applicable to both binary and ternary alloys. The microscopic mechanism arises from the electron redistribution in the local stacking fault area. Moreover, for ternary Nb-Ti based alloys, the interaction between Ti and the third alloying elements has negligible effect on the SFE of the systems, and the valence-electron rule still dominates. The alloying effects on the ductility are further illustrated based on the ratio between surface energies and SFEs. The composition-SFE-ductility map obtained by our theoretical calculations is calibrated by available experimental data.},

@article{Seiser2011a,
abstract = {The traditional methods for predicting the occurrence of deleterious topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in Ni-based superalloys have been based on the PHACOMP and newPHACOMP methodologies. These schemes use the average number of holes Nh or the centre of gravity of the elemental d-bands Md to predict whether or not a given multicomponent alloy will be prone to TCP formation. However, as both these one-dimensional methodologies are well-known to fail with respect to new generations of alloys, a novel two-dimensional structure map (N,$\Delta$V/V) is introduced where N is the average electron concentration and $\Delta$V/V is a composition-dependent size-factor difference. This map is found to separate the experimental data on the TCP phases of binary A-B transition metal alloys into well-defined but sometimes overlapping regions corresponding to different structure types such as A15, $\sigma$, $\chi$, R, P, $\delta$, $\mu$, M and Laves. Detailed investigations of ternary phase diagrams and multicomponent systems show that TCP phases, regardless of the number of constituents, are located in the same regions of the structure map that are favoured by the binary compounds of the same structure type. The structure map is then used in conjunction with CALPHAD computations of $\sigma$ phase stability to show that the predictive power of newPHACOMP for the seven component Ni-Co-Cr-Ta-W-Re-Al system studied recently by Reed et al. [24] is indeed poor. This supports a growing consensus that robust methods of TCP phase prediction in multicomponent alloys will require the inclusion of reliable first-principles thermodynamic databases within the semi-empirical CALPHAD scheme. {\textcopyright} 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 ISIJ. Although a few studies on the fracture behavior of dual phase (DP) steels have been conducted, the mechanism of impact fracture in DP steels has not yet been clarified. In this study, the ductile to brittle transition behavior in ferrite + pearlite DP steel sheets was evaluated using the Charpy impact test with a sub-size specimen. The absorbed energy of DP steel decreased with decreasing temperature and the transition curve had a clear "middle shelf" existing between upper and lower shelves. The fracture surface at the middle shelf was flat and contained few dimples, similar to that at the lower shelf. Ferrite grains just below the fracture surface obviously received plastic strain with fracture on the middle shelf. This result indicated that the fracture mode on the middle shelf was quasi-cleavage fracture (QCF). Furthermore, on the lower shelf, ferrite grains received very small plastic strain with fracture. The two step ductile to brittle transition in this study corresponded to the fracture mode that changed from microvoid coalescence fracture to QCF and from QCF to cleavage fracture.},

In this paper, we investigate the energy and structure of dislocations, and also the generalized stacking fault energies in NiTi austenite by implementing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Through our results the validity and accuracy of three different potentials, two EAM potentials with different cutoff radii and one 2NN MEAM potential, for studying defect related properties of NiTi alloys is investigated. It is shown that while none of these potentials are particularly trained for predicting defect properties in NiTi systems, they can be efficiently utilized to study the stacking fault energies, the energy and structure of edge dislocations, stress distributions at the vicinity of edge dislocations, and even the details of dislocation dissociation in NiTi austenite phase. Particularly our results can be used as a tool to select the appropriate potential for studying any problem related to a specific aspect of defects in austenite NiTi SMAs.},

Large grain size and relatively low SFE are two critical requirements for the formation of the optimum gradient structure. A superior combination of high strength and good ductility can be achieved by torsional treatment in ultra-coarse-grained materials with low SFEs, which is attributed to the hierarchical structures that led to the simultaneous activations of different deformation mechanisms from full dislocation activities to partial dislocation slip and nano-twinning along the radial direction.},

This was achieved by looking at two different martensitic structures with PAG sizes of approximately 40 $\mu$m and 80 $\mu$m, produced by hot rolling to different reductions. Two ageing heat-treatments were considered: both heat-treatments consisted of austenisation at 960 °C, then aging at 560 °C for 5 h, but while one was rapidly cooled the other was slow cooled and then extended aged at 480 °C for 64 h. It is shown that for the shorter ageing treatment the smaller PAG size resulted in significant improvements in strength (increase of more than 150 MPa), ductility (four times increase), creep life (almost four times increase in creep life) and fatigue life (almost doubled). Whereas, the extended aged sample showed similar changes in the fatigue life, elongation and hardness it displayed yet showed no difference in tensile strength and creep. These results display the complexity of microstructural contributions to mechanical properties in maraging steels.},

The magnetic transition, observed at 649 K, is accompanied by a significant increase in the thermal expansion coefficient. The phase stability is analyzed as a function of temperature via the calculated free energies accounting for the structural, magnetic, electronic, vibrational and configurational contributions. The single- and polycrystal elastic modulus for the ferro- and paramagnetic states of the face-centered and body-centered cubic phases are presented. By combining the measured and theoretically predicted temperature-dependent lattice parameters, we reveal the structural and magnetic origin of the observed anomalous thermal expansion behavior.

abstract = {The equilibrium crystal shape is a convex shape bound by the lowest energy interfaces. In many polycrystalline microstructures created by grain growth, the observed distribution of grain boundary planes appears to be dominated at low driving forces (after long grain growth times) by the planes present in the equilibrium crystal shape. However, at earlier stages of grain growth, it is expected that kinetic effects will play an important role in grain boundary motion and morphology. Analogous to the equilibrium crystal shape, the kinetic crystal shape of seed crystals growing from a liquid at higher supersaturations is bound by the slowest growing orientations. This study presents an equivalent construction for grain boundaries in polycrystals and uses it to determine the kinetic crystal shape for strontium titanate as a function of temperature. Relative grain boundary mobilities for strontium titanate for the low energy crystallographic orientations from seeded polycrystal experiments are used to calculate the kinetic crystal shapes as a function of temperature and annealing atmosphere. The kinetic crystal shapes are then compared to the morphologies and orientations of the interfaces of the growing seed crystals, and to the equilibrium crystal shapes, as well. The conclusions are that (1) the kinetic crystal shape is extremely anisotropic and displays significant transitions as a function of temperature that do not mirror changes in equilibrium crystal shape, (2) the kinetic shapes observed in the microstructures are dominated by the growing side of the interface (single crystal) and not by the dissolving side (polycrystalline matrix), and (3) faster growing orientations break up into macroscopic facets composed of slower growing orientations. The implications for grain growth underscore the applicability of crystal growth models to grain growth in polycrystals. In particular, in strontium titanate, the anisotropy of the grain boundary mobility as represented in the kinetic crystal shape is expected to be reduced from five macroscopic parameters to two (interface normal) allowing for incorporation of growth rate anisotropy in simulations of microstructure evolution at the earliest stages of grain growth, i.e. at the highest driving forces.},

abstract = {A series of stress reduction experiments was conducted on high purity polycrystalline aluminum. Initial stresses of 8.27, 10.3 and 12.4 MPa at 573 K and 3.44 MPa at 673 K were used, and stress reductions were made during steady state creep at approximately 22{\%} true strain. For each initial stress, the constant substructure strain rates are characterized by an exponential dependence of rate on the reduced stress. These data are consistent with an exponential form of the kinetic law for flow within subgrain interiors, which is based on the theory of obstacle-controlled dislocation glide. In addition, the experimentally determined slopes for each set of constant substructure strain rate-vs-reduced stress data vary approximately as the inverse of the initial stress. This finding suggests that the strength of the microstructure scales with the initial applied stress. Finally, it is proposed that the activation energy for dislocation glide can be determined from a combination of constant structure and steady state creep data. The results of this analysis suggest that the thermal activation process may be controlled by lattice self-diffusion. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The Frank-Read (FR) source is a well-known intragranular dislocation source that plays an important role in size-dependent dislocation multiplication in metallic crystals. In this work, we extend a phase-field dislocation dynamics (PFDD) technique to study FR source operation on the {\{}110{\}}, {\{}112{\}}, and {\{}123{\}} slip planes in body-centered cubic (BCC) crystals. Here, the periodic lattice potentials for shearing across these planes used in PFDD simulations are provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations for six BCC refractory metals, Cr, Mo, Nb, Ta, V, and W. The DFT calculations show that the group 6 elements (Cr, Mo, and W) have higher generalized stacking fault energies than the group 5 elements (Nb, Ta, and V). With PFDD, we focus on the effects of the GSFE curve shape, initial character angle, slip plane crystallography, and elastic anisotropy (measured by the Zener ratio, Ac) on the critical stresses to activate the FR source. For the same FR source of any character angle in the same metal, the critical stress on the {\{}123{\}} plane is lower than those on the {\{}110{\}} and {\{}112{\}} planes. It is also shown that elastic anisotropy decreases the critical stress when Ac {\textless} 1 and increases it when Ac {\textgreater} 1. We also find that in both Cr and Nb, which possess the lowest values of Ac among the six metals, elastic anisotropy causes the critical stress on {\{}110{\}} planes to achieve a local maximum for the mixed 45∘ oriented FR source.},

Using the CALPHAD approach, phase diagrams for these alloys are calculated to identify the solidus (melting, Tm) temperatures and volume fractions of secondary phases. Correlations were identified between the strength drops at 1000 °C and 1200 °C and the alloy compositions, room temperature properties, melting temperatures and volume fractions of secondary phases. The influence of alloy density on the temperature dependence of specific yield strength was also explored. The conducted analysis suggests that the loss of high-temperature strength of single-phase BCC RCCAs is related to the activation of diffusion-controlled deformation mechanisms, which occurs at T ≥ 0.6 Tm, so that the alloys with higher Tm retain their strength to higher temperatures. On the other hand, a rapid decrease in strength of multi-phase RCCAs with increasing temperature above 1000 °C is probably due to dissolution of secondary phases.},

abstract = {The desire to reduce carbon emissions from traditional power generation assets is driving an increase in power production from renewables. However, an issue with large increases in renewable power generation is the lack of dispatchability; without adding storage or firming capability, increases in renewables can strain a power grid. Gas turbines can be used to fill this gap, but there are questions about the long-term use of these assets in a carbon-free energy ecosystem. An advantage for gas turbines is that they are able to operate on hydrogen(H 2), which does not provide any carbon emissions when combusted. This includes both new gas turbines and existing units which can be converted to operation on a high H 2 fuel. This paper will provide an update on how gas turbines can support a low or reduced carbon electrical grid by operating on a wide variety of lower carbon fuels, including current hydrogen capabilities of GE gas turbines, requirements for upgrading existing turbines for operation on hydrogen fuels, and potential future technology options. 2},

abstract = {An analytic model describing substitutional solid solution strengthening in body-centered cubic (BCC) complex, concentrated alloys (CCAs) based on a/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocation mobility is developed and presented. At lower temperatures it is assumed that dipole dragging is the rate limiting strengthening mechanism, and as the temperature increases this changes to a jog dragging mechanism. While both mechanisms are contained in Suzuki's classical model for substitutional solid solution strengthening developed for BCC alloys significant modifications are required to apply such a model to the refractory CCA's. First, two approaches for incorporating the net effects of the complex solute chemistry are developed and contrasted using a ternary NbTaTi alloy and four quaternary alloys, MoNbTaTi, WNbTaTi, CrMoNbTi and CrMoTaTi. Our model is extended to higher temperatures and applied to analyze experimental yield data as a function of temperature (0.15–0.7TL, where TL is the absolute liquidus temperature) and strain rate (10−5 to 10−2/s) in a range of BCC chemically complex alloys including stoichiometric NbTiZr and HfNbTaTiZr. We find that the model, based on just these two mechanisms, gives excellent agreement with experimental yield data in both these BCC CCAs, NbTiZr and HfNbTaTiZr. The experimental yield data of these two BCC CCA's as well as NbTaTi and four quaternaries are also analyzed using Maresca's edge dislocation model developed for these types of alloys. The screw model presented is useful in predicting BCC CCAs with adequate high temperature strength, which will accelerate development of high temperature, high strength BCC alloys for aerospace applications.},

Unfortunately, these small amounts of oxygen also lead to a markedly decreased ductility, which in turn drives the increased cost to purify titanium to avoid this oxygen poisoning effect. Here, we report a systematic study on the oxygen sensitivity of titanium that provides a clear mechanistic view of how oxygen impurities affect the mechanical properties of titanium. The increased slip planarity of Ti-O alloys is caused by an interstitial shuffling mechanism, which is sensitive to temperature, strain rate, and oxygen content and leads to the subsequent alteration of deformation twinning behavior. The insights from our experimental and computational work provide a rationale for the design of titanium alloys with increased tolerance to variations in interstitial content, with notable implications for more widespread use of titanium alloys.},

Free atomic transfer among cells is achieved via the application of the lever rule, where an assigned molar ratio virtually controls the percentage of each cell in the overall simulation, making (MC)2 the first successful algorithm for simulating phase coexistence in crystalline solids. During the application of this method, all energies are directly computed via density functional theory calculations. We test the method by successful prediction of the stable phases of known binary systems. We then apply the method to a quaternary high-entropy alloy. The method is particularly powerful in predicting stable phases of multicomponent systems, for which phase diagrams do not exist.},

More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.},

Subcritical crack growth (SCG) measurements were made on uniformly precharged specimens containing up to 50 weight parts per million (wt ppm) hydrogen, and the behavior was correlated with metallographic observations. For intermediate hydrogen concentrations, three-stage SCG rate vs stress intensity behavior was observed in IN718 and IN625 but not in A286. For all alloys, the threshold stress intensity decreased with increasing hydrogen concentration. Cracking in the nickel alloys was transgranular, and there was a transition from dimpled to faceted failure as the hydrogen concentration increased. Failure in A286 was mainly by intergranular microvoid coalescence at high hydrogen concentrations. Enhanced localization of plasticity and void pressurization due to hydrogen are proposed to explain the observed hydrogen embrittlement of these alloys. The effects of hydrogen on the stacking fault energy, trapping sites, microstructure, and cracking ahead of the main crack front are discussed with reference to the above alloys and their hydrogen embrittlement. {\textcopyright} 1992 The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, and ASM International.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The microstructure of the steel was characterised. Charpy impact tests were carried out in the temperature range from 373. K to 4.2. K and the fracture surfaces were analysed. The effective grain size responsible for the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature corresponded to the grain size of the large grain size regions. The mechanism of this phenomenon was attributed to the characteristics of the grain boundaries, as high angle grain boundaries are more effective in impeding cleavage crack propagation. The grain size of the large grain size regions was important in determining the DBTT because these grain boundaries were high angle grain boundaries, whereas the small gain size regions were dominated by the low angle grain boundaries. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The solubility limits of alloying elements in the compositional space were defined for the $\gamma$-$\gamma$' structure at 800 °C. The present model was calibrated with high entropy superalloys (HESAs) from the literature and experimentally validated by the synthesis of HESAs with an extended range of Al (10.5–15 at{\%}) and (Al+Ti)-concentrations (up to 20 at{\%}). The Ni51Co18Fe5Cr10Al12Ti4 HESA developed using the present approach exhibited a $\gamma$'-volume fraction of 63{\%}, $\gamma$'-dissolution temperature of 1188 °C and showed excellent coarsening resistance and strength retention at 800 °C.

@article{Chen2020a,
abstract = {We propose a probabilistic model coupling with the temperature dependent constitutive relationship to describe the competition between the cleavage and ductile void failure of ferritic/martensitic steels with irradiation effects. It is found that both the material deformation and failure modes exhibit significant temperature dependence. Regarding the material deformation, two regimes have been found for the ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT). At low temperature, the flow stress is controlled by the mobility of screw dislocations. The high-temperature regime is about the thermally activated jog drag of dislocations. The failure modes depend on the carbide precipitate and temperature. Cleavage micro-cracks initiate at the carbide sites at low temperature giving rise to brittle behaviors. At high temperature, void nucleation evolving from the carbide precipitate suppresses the cleavage nucleation and propagation, and leads to good ductility. It is demonstrated that the competition between the cleavage fracture and ductile void failure is the major mechanism for the DBT. Our probabilistic model successfully predicts the temperature-dependent fracture toughness and ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). Besides temperature, irradiation has a significant effect on the DBT of steels. Upon irradiation, the steels exhibit both irradiation hardening and irradiation embrittlement, i.e., rise in yield and flow stresses, and increase on DBTT. The main reason for these irradiation effects is that the irradiation-induced hardening increases the flow stress, and the plasticity localization weakens the overall hindering effect from ductile void growth on the cleavage nucleation and propagation, promoting the development of cleavage. Our probabilistic model takes into account the cleavage nucleation-propagation process and the influence of ductile void growth simultaneously, and it gives a sound explanation for the fundamental relation between the DBTT and mechanical properties of metallic materials.},

The model parameterized in V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and Fe, is used to study the kink-pair activation enthalpy and spatial extension. Interestingly, we find that the atomistic line tension is more than twice the usual elastic estimates. The calculations also show interesting group tendencies with the line tension and kink-pair width larger in group V than in group VI elements. Finally, the present kink-pair activation energies are shown to compare qualitatively with experimental data and potential origins of quantitative discrepancies are discussed.},

Thus, HEAs usually possess a single phase (contrary to expectations according to the composition of the alloy) and exhibit a high level of performance in different properties related to many developing areas in industry. Despite this significant interest, most HEAs have been developed via ingot metallurgy. More recently, powder metallurgy (PM) has appeared as an interesting alternative for further developing this family of alloys to possibly widen the field of nanostructures in HEAs and improve some capabilities of these alloys. In this paper, PM methods applied to HEAs are reviewed, and some possible ways to develop the use of powders as raw materials are introduced.},

Test specimens were taken from the top, middle and bottom regions of each ingot. The RRR measurements were performed with a GM cryocooler system and more than 60{\%} of the samples exceeded RRR values of 250. Room temperature tensile tests were performed on samples from the same regions. 17 samples were machined according to ASTM standard test methods for tension testing of metallic material. Tests were performed with an Instron tensile/compression testing machine, and various mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, 0.2{\%} proof stress, ultimate tensile strength and strain at fracture were measured. For all the samples, the fracture strain exceeds 35{\%} while the ultimate tensile stress is close to 100 MPa. Contents of impurity (N, O, C, H, Ta) of each region of the seven ingots were also measured. These data provide insights for a possible correlation among RRR values, mechanical properties and impurity contents of niobium ingots.},

abstract = {Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) emerge as promising candidate materials for ultrahigh-temperature applications. Accurate phase stability is the prerequisite for design of high-performance RHEAs, but still missing in the literature due to the big challenge in experiments. In this paper, the reliable 3rd-generation Gibbs energy expressions for pure Mo, Nb, Ta and W were firstly evaluated by integrating the physical based Segmented Regression model with thermal vacancy description from 0 K to high temperatures. The thermodynamic database of the Mo-Nb-Ta-W quaternary system was then developed by combining the established 3rd-generation Gibbs energies with the phase equilibrium and thermodynamic data by using the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) approach. The calculated phase equilibria, thermodynamic properties as well as the A2/B2 ordering transition behaviors show good agreement with those from experimental determination and theoretical calculation. The phase constitutes and elemental distributions in an equiatomic MoNbTaW as-cast alloy were experimentally investigated and compared with the non-equilibrium solidification simulations to further verify the database reliability. The high-throughput mapping of phase stability within the composition-temperature space in various Mo-Nb-Ta-W alloys was then constructed by applying thermodynamic calculations. The alloying effects on the formation of B2 phase were systematically analyzed. The Mo-Nb-Ta-W alloys have a wide temperature region with a single A2 phase, while the A2 + B2 phase regions exist at very low temperatures. It is highly anticipated that the present accurate 3rd-generation thermodynamic database provides an important basis for efficient design and development of novel Mo-Nb-Ta-W RHEAs.},

abstract = {Mechanical responses of tungsten (W) and its alloys are strongly controlled by the properties of 1/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocations. Rhenium (Re), as a typical alloying and transmutation element in W, can substantially modify the properties of the dislocations, thus the plasticity of the materials. In this study, we investigate the interaction of Re and Re clusters with the screw dislocations in W by first-principles calculations in combination with theoretical models. Specifically, we propose two competing and Re-distribution dependent mechanisms, i.e. “ductilizing effect” and “hardening effect”; both are crucial to the mechanical properties of W. For the ductilizing effect, dispersed Re atoms weaken the surrounding interatomic interaction and reduce the shear resistance, thus facilitating the motion of the dislocation. In contrast, for the hardening effect, Re clusters formed by aggregated Re atoms due to irradiation can increase the Peierls stress and energy, thus hindering the motion of the dislocations. The proposed mechanisms shed light on the experimental observations that there is a Re-induced transition from ductilizing to hardening due to irradiation. The current work provides a theoretical guidance to the development of W-based future fusion materials in search of ductilizing alloying elements.},

Especially, fracture appearance transition temperature (FATT) in Charpy impact test is one of the most important properties of steel to assure material reliability. As microstructural factors to govern FATT, the effective grain size (d EFF ) on cleavage fracture surfaces is well known in ferrite-pearlitic and martensitic steels. However, the relationship between FATT and d EFF have not yet been clarified for the steels with Zw. Low-alloy heat-resistant steels for pressure vessels such as Cr-Mo steels are the type with Zw and demands for better low temperature toughness are becoming severer in recent years. The present study aims to determine the relationship between FATT and d EFF , and to clarify the microstructural factor to govern toughness in quenched and tempered Cr-Mo steel with a Zw microstructure by varying the prior austenite grain size. Not the prior austenite grain size but the bainite block section width corresponded to d EFF in the size distribution. Accordingly, FATT decreased with decreasing block section width.},

We report on a high-throughput alloy processing and characterization methodology, leveraging laser-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) and mechanical testing techniques, to enable rapid exploration of RHEAs/RCCAs. We utilized in situ alloying and compositional grading, unique to AM processing, to rapidly-produce RHEAs/RCCAs using readily available and inexpensive commercial elemental powders. We demonstrate this approach with the MoNbTaW alloy system, as a model material known for having exceptionally high strength at elevated temperature when processed using conventional methods (e.g., casting). Microstructure analysis, chemical composition, and strain rate dependent hardness of AM-processed material are presented and discussed in the context of understanding the structure-properties relationships of RHEAs/RCCAs.},

abstract = {A long-standing limitation of first-principles calculations of substitutional alloy phase diagrams is the difficulty in accounting for lattice vibrations. A survey of the theoretical and experimental literature seeking to quantify the effect of lattice vibrations on phase stability indicates that they can be significant. Typical vibrational entropy differences between phases are of the order of 0.1 to 0.2kB/atom, which is comparable to the typical values of configurational entropy differences in binary alloys (at most 0.693kB/atom). This article presents the basic formalism underlying ab initio phase diagram calculations, along with the generalization required to account for lattice vibrations. The authors review the various techniques allowing the theoretical calculation and the experimental determination of phonon dispersion curves and related thermodynamic quantities, such as vibrational entropy or free energy. A clear picture of the origin of vibrational entropy differences between phases in an alloy system is presented that goes beyond the traditional bond counting and volume change arguments. Vibrational entropy change can be attributed to the changes in chemical bond stiffness associated with the changes in bond length that take place during a phase transformation. This so-called "bond stiffness vs bond length" interpretation both summarizes the key phenomenon driving vibrational entropy changes and provides a practical tool to model them.},

abstract = {Multicomponent alloys with multiple principal elements including high entropy alloys (HEAs) and compositionally complex alloys (CCAs) are attracting rapidly growing attention. The endless possibilities to explore new alloys and the hope for better combinations of materials properties have stimulated a remarkable number of research works in the last years. Most of these works have been based on experimental approaches, but ab initio calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiment and serves as a predictive tool for the identification and characterization of promising alloys. The theoretical ab initio modeling of phase stabilities and mechanical properties of multi-principal element alloys by means of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed. A general thermodynamic framework is laid down that provides a bridge between the quantities accessible with DFT and the targeted thermodynamic and mechanical properties. How chemical disorder and various finite-temperature excitations can be modeled with DFT is shown. Different concepts to study crystal and alloy phase stabilities, the impact of lattice distortions (a core effect of HEAs), magnetic transitions, and chemical short-range order are discussed along with specific examples. Strategies to study elastic properties, stacking fault energies, and their dependence on, e.g., temperature or alloy composition are illustrated. Finally, we provide an extensive compilation of multi-principal element alloys and various material properties studied with DFT so far (a set of over 500 alloy-property combinations).},

abstract = {The metastable high- and medium entropy alloys (HEAs or MEAs) have drawn many attentions regarding deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties. Most of their studies have conducted under quasi–static or uniaxial tensile/compressive loading conditions. For cryogenic applications, however, the fracture or impact toughness should be carefully evaluated because it is one of the most important indices for the low–temperature performance. In this study, quasi–static and dynamic tensile properties of a metastable VCrFeCoNi HEA were investigated at room and cryogenic temperatures, and they were systematically correlated with the Charpy impact toughness. Under the quasi–static tensile loading, the Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) mechanism occurred at room temperature, while the Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) from FCC to BCC phases via an intermediate HCP phase occurred at cryogenic temperature. Under the dynamic loading, more deformation twins were formed at room temperature, and the amount of martensite reduced at cryogenic temperature. These variations of twinning and martensitic transformation were elucidated by the raised flow stress and by the adiabatic heating effect, respectively. They were confirmed by combining with ab–initio calculations, leading to the strong dependency of the energetic stability of BCC and HCP phases relative to the FCC phase. As a result, a plenty of deformation twins under the dynamic loading resulted in the high impact toughness of 112.6 J at room temperature. The martensitic transformation and consequently refined network structure played key roles in sustaining the remarkable toughness and in preventing the DBT phenomenon as the test temperature decreased.},

Tensile tests were conducted at ambient temperature, and deformation microstructures were investigated using electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. It is found that strain-hardening curves changed dramatically with grain refinement. Deformation twinning prevails when the grain size is coarse, but it is absent when the grain size falls in the ultrafine-grained (UFG) regime. The transition of twinning behavior is supposed to be determined by the increased twinning stress with grain refinement. It is indicated that the twinning behavior of the HEAs is strongly dependent on the competition between the flow stress and critical twinning stress with grain refinement.},

abstract = {This article describes a new computation-based approach for designing ductile Nb-Ti-Cr-Al solid-solution alloys. The proposed approach is based on computation of the surface energy and the Peierls-Nabarro (P-N) barrier energy as a function of alloy composition. The surface energy is used as a measure of the resistance to cleavage fracture, while the P-N barrier energy is used as a measure of dislocation mobility. The ratio of the surface energy to the P-N barrier energy is utilized as a material index which can be adjusted by alloying additions. Analytical relations are developed for computing (1) the elastic constants in terms of the d + s electrons per atom in the alloys and (2) the lattice parameter, surface energy, and P-N barrier energy in terms of alloy composition. Design of a ductile solid-solution alloy is achieved by manipulating the number of d + s electrons, through alloying additions, to obtain a high value of the ratio of the surface to P-N barrier energy by reducing the misfit energy of the dislocation core. Applications of the methodology to designing binary, ternary, and quaternary Nb-based solid-solution alloys with Ti, Cr, and Al alloying additions are illustrated with promising results, demonstrating that the proposed methodology is a viable approach for alloy design.},

abstract = {Developing high-strength and ductile face-centered cubic (fcc) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has attracted significant attention. The generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) is a very useful concept to describe stable and unstable planar defects and their energies on a slip plane. It plays an essential role in designing high performance fcc HEAs and understanding the nanoscale plasticity phenomena. In this work, using first-principles simulations, we investigate the configuration-averaged GSFEs of 29 single-phase fcc HEAs and identify indicators that can be used to tune stacking fault energies. First we determine the equilibrium structural parameters for all considered alloys and compare them with available experimental data. With the obtained GSFEs, we analyze the relationship between the stacking fault energies and materials properties, and investigate scaling relations between planar fault energies and the tendencies to exhibit deformation twinning and transformation to hexagonal close-packed martensite. We find that unstable SFE and shear modulus correlates strongly. Moreover, we reveal that the ratio of intrinsic SFE to unstable SFE, $\gamma$isf/$\gamma$usf, is a characteristic materials measure, and the tendencies to twinning and martensitic transformation rank with it. Our results are expected to be useful for an efficient alloy design and selection of solutes in fcc HEAs.},

abstract = {CoFeMnSi has been both experimentally and theoretically proven as a novel spin-gapless semiconductor and resulted in a new research direction in equiatomic full Heusler compounds. Using the first-principles calculation method, we investigated the electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties of CoFeMnSi material in this study. The obtained lattice constant under the LiMgPdSn-type Heusler structure is 5.611 {\AA} and it is fairly consistent with previous experimental results and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the achieved total magnetic moment of 4 µB follows the Slater–Pauling rule as Mtotal = Ztotal − 24, where Mtotal is the total magnetic moment per formula unit and Ztotal is the total valence electron number, i.e., 28 for CoFeMnSi material. We have also examined the mechanical properties of CoFeMnSi and computed its elastic constants and various moduli. Results show CoFeMnSi behaves in a ductile fashion and its strong elastic anisotropy is revealed with the help of the 3D-directional-dependent Young's and shear moduli. Both mechanical and dynamic stabilities of CoFeMnSi are verified. In addition, strain effects on the electronic and magnetic properties of CoFeMnSi have been investigated, including both uniform and tetragonal strains, and we found that the spin-gapless feature is easily destroyed with both strain conditions, yet the total magnetic moment maintains a good stability. Furthermore, the specific behaviors under various temperatures and pressures have been accessed by the thermodynamic properties with a quasi-harmonic Debye model, including bulk modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, Gr{\"{u}}neisen constant, heat capacity and Debye temperature. This comprehensive study can offer a very helpful and valuable reference for other relative research works.},

abstract = {Abstract Sluggish diffusion kinetics is an important contributor to the outstanding properties of high-entropy alloys. However, the diffusion kinetics in high-entropy alloys has never been probed directly. Here, the diffusion couple method was used to measure the diffusion parameters of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni in ideal-solution-like Co--Cr--Fe--Mn--Ni alloys. These parameters were compared with those in various conventional face-centered cubic metals. The results show that the diffusion coefficients in the Co--Cr--Fe--Mn--Ni alloys are indeed lower than those in the reference metals. Correspondingly, the activation energies in the high-entropy alloys are higher than those in the reference metals. Moreover, the trend of the normalized activation energy is positively related to the number of composing elements in the matrix. A quasi-chemical model is proposed to analyze the fluctuation of lattice potential energy in different matrices and to explain the observed trend in activation energies. Greater fluctuation of lattice potential energy produces more significant atomic traps and blocks, leading to higher activation energies, and thus accounts for the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys.},

abstract = {Focuses on the thermodynamical aspects of the theory of deformation, relating thermodynamical quantities to experimental measurements and discussing a selection of experimental results covering the range of BCC metals and alloys. It is clear that all BCC metals and alloys exhibit thermally-activated flow of dislocations over a Peierls barrier at sufficiently low temperatures. For potassium there appears to be good agreement between the extrapolated yield stress at absolute zero and the value calculated from an atomistic model, but in general the experimental results show that individual metals or chemical groups have certain characteristics which complicate the deformation process and that a simple analysis based on a singly-activated process is insufficient. This is particularly true for very pure metals which might be expected to deform by the simplest process. Alloying elements and impurities, especially interstitials, may modify the Peierls potential, present additional barriers to dislocation motion and also influence the activation process, particularly at intermediate temperatures. Undoubtedly much of this complication is due to the core structures of the dislocations and although the general framework of the deformation process appears to be understood fairly well, some of the details seem even more arcane now than 30 years ago},

abstract = {The mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in a $\gamma$'-Ni 3(Al,Ti) phase strengthened Fe-Ni based austenitic alloy has been investigated in detail. Hot hydrogen charging experiment and tensile test reveal that the alloy with coherent $\gamma$' phase exhibits a much higher decrease in reduction of area (RA) than that of the alloy in the solution-treated state. However, three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) experiment shows that segregation of hydrogen atoms is not found at the coherent interface between the $\gamma$' phase and the matrix, which indicates that the interface is not a strong hydrogen trap. Furthermore, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation indicates that the interface coherency is maintained during the deformation, even tensile to fracture. It is found that macroscale slip band rupture and intergranular fracture are promoted by serious dislocation planar slip, which become the predominant features in the tensile-to-fracture sample after hydrogen charging. This phenomenon has been interpreted as a result of combined effects of the $\gamma$' phase and hydrogen in the precipitation-strengthened Fe-Ni based austenitic alloy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The valence electron concentration (VEC) is an important physical factor for phase formation. A high VEC is conducive to forming an FCC phase and improving an alloy's ductility, while a low VEC is beneficial in forming a BCC phase that improves an alloy's strength. This is demonstrated for two HEAs, CoCrCuFeNi (FCC) and AlCoCrFeNi (BCC), that were designed as matrix alloys, where Ni and Mo are alloyed. The microstructure, phase evolution, and the mechanical properties for (AlCoCrFeNi)100-xNix and (CoCrCuFeNi)100-xMox were systematically investigated. As the phase structure for the (AlCoCrFeNi)100-xNix high entropy alloy (HEA) transformed from a BCC to an FCC crystal structure as the Ni content increased from 0 at.{\%} to 16 at.{\%}, the FCC volume fraction increased from 0{\%} to 85{\%}, its compressive fracture strain increased from 25{\%} to 40{\%}, its VEC increased from 7.2 to 7.6. As the phase structure for the (CoCrCuFeNi)100-xMox HEA transformed from FCC to BCC as the Mo content increased from 0 at.{\%} to 16 at.{\%}, the BCC volume fraction increased from 0{\%} to 65{\%}, its compressive yield strength increased from 260 MPa to 928 MPa, its VEC decreased from 8.8 to 8.3. Selecting an element based upon an alloy's VEC is a practical method for designing compositions for HEAs that balance strength and ductility. According to the needs of practical applications, balancing both strength and plasticity requires the following criteria for selecting an element for incorporation into an HEA system: matrix strength is improved by selecting an element with a VEC lower than the average VEC of the matrix, while ductility is improved by selecting another element with a VEC higher than the average VEC for the matrix.},

The beneficial effect of Ti addition in enhancing the fracture resistance of Nb-based in-situ composites is established and explained on the basis of a reduced Peierls-Nabarro barrier energy, whose reduction leads to increased dislocation mobility and plastic flow in the solid solution phase. Recent modeling efforts to increase the fracture resistance of intermetallic and in-situ composites using computational approaches to identify alloying effects are summarized. One approach that relies on computation methods to design the matrix compositions of the ductile phase for optimum fracture resistance and ductility is highlighted.

The studied results show that the compressive yield strength (YS) is as high as 1399 MPa, with a fracture strain of 10.9{\%} at room temperature. At 800 °C and 1000 °C, the YS is still preserved at 875 MPa and 240 MPa, respectively, due to the higher load-carrying capacity of the silicide at elevated temperatures. Comparison to similar refractory HEAs shows that, the composite microstructure is beneficial for better room temperature strength and ductility as well as the elevated temperature properties.},

abstract = {In this work, the synergistic effect of Re and W on the evolution of the topological close-packed phases (TCP) in Nickel-based superalloys were studied by means of Thermo-Calculation (TC), solidifying slowly, Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), and solution-aging treatment. The specimens were analyzed by means of SEM-EDS, TEM-SADP, and EPMA. The calculated results indicated that the P phase precipitated prior to the $\mu$ phase with the temperature decrease, and both phases $\mu$ and P coexisted in a certain temperature range when the content of Re was higher ( Re: 5–7 wt{\%}) and the content of W was lower ( W:4–6 wt{\%}); Only phase $\mu$ precipitated from the alloy when Re content was less than 4 wt{\%} and W content was higher than 7 wt{\%}. The experimental results showed that the $\mu$ phases were slats-like and distributed in parallel in different orientations; and the $\mu$/P intergrowth phases with coherent relationship were short rod-like. In addition, the gathered $\mu$/P intergrowth phases around the big blocky-like $\gamma$' phases were found in alloys solidified slowly, which was prone to cause holes. Based on phase-transition temperature obtained by combining calculation and DTA, the solution-aging process of the alloys were determined. After solution-aging treatment, the long strip shape $\mu$ phases and short rod-like $\mu$/P intergrowth phases distributed uniformly in the matrix, and the big blocky-like $\gamma$' phases and holes disappeared. The experimental results showed that the total amount of TCP phase decreased and the P phase gradually disappeared when the content of Re decreased and the content of W increased. The research results had a guiding role in optimizing the composition of alloys and predicting the safety performance of aerocraft during the flight cycle.},

abstract = {It is well known that screw dislocation motion dominates the plastic deformation in body-centered-cubic metals at low temperatures. The nature of the nonplanar structure of screw dislocations gives rise to high lattice friction, which results in strong temperature and strain rate dependence of plastic flow. Thus the nature of the Peierls potential, which is responsible for the high lattice resistance, is an important physical property of the material. However, current empirical potentials give a complicated picture of the Peierls potential. Here, we investigate the nature of the Peierls potential using density functional theory in the bcc transition metals. The results show that the shape of the Peierls potential is sinusoidal for every material investigated. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of the potential scales strongly with the energy per unit length of the screw dislocation in the material. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys are a class of materials that contain five or more elements in near-equiatomic proportions1,2. Their unconventional compositions and chemical structures hold promise for achieving unprecedented combinations of mechanical properties3–8. Rational design of such alloys hinges on an understanding of the composition–structure–property relationships in a near-infinite compositional space9,10. Here we use atomic-resolution chemical mapping to reveal the element distribution of the widely studied face-centred cubic CrMnFeCoNi Cantor alloy2and of a new face-centred cubic alloy, CrFeCoNiPd. In the Cantor alloy, the distribution of the five constituent elements is relatively random and uniform. By contrast, in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, in which the palladium atoms have a markedly different atomic size and electronegativity from the other elements, the homogeneity decreases considerably; all five elements tend to show greater aggregation, with a wavelength of incipient concentration waves11,12as small as 1 to 3 nanometres. The resulting nanoscale alternating tensile and compressive strain fields lead to considerable resistance to dislocation glide. In situ transmission electron microscopy during straining experiments reveals massive dislocation cross-slip from the early stage of plastic deformation, resulting in strong dislocation interactions between multiple slip systems. These deformation mechanisms in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, which differ markedly from those in the Cantor alloy and other face-centred cubic high-entropy alloys, are promoted by pronounced fluctuations in composition and an increase in stacking-fault energy, leading to higher yield strength without compromising strain hardening and tensile ductility. Mapping atomic-scale element distributions opens opportunities for understanding chemical structures and thus providing a basis for tuning composition and atomic configurations to obtain outstanding mechanical properties.},

abstract = {The fundamental atomic-level properties of (a/2) {\'{a}}111{\~{n}} screw dislocations and other defects in bcc Ta have been simulated by means of new quantum-based multi-ion interatomic potentials derived from the model generalized pseudopotential theory (MGPT). The potentials have been validated in detail using a combination of experimental data and ab-initio electronic structure calculations on ideal shear strength, vacancy and self-interstitial formation and migration energies, grain-boundary atomic structure and generalized stacking- fault energy ($\gamma$) surfaces. Robust and accurate two- and three-dimensional Green's function (GF) techniques have been used to relax dynamically the boundary forces during the dislocation simulations. The GF techniques have been implemented in combination with a spatial domain decomposition strategy, resulting in a parallel MGPT atomistic simulation code that increases computational performance by two orders of magnitude. Our dislocation simulations predict a degenerate core structure with threefold symmetry for Ta, but one that is nearly isotropic and only weakly polarized at ambient pressure. The degenerate nature of the core structure leads to possible antiphase defects (APDs) on the dislocation line as well as multiple possible dislocation kinks and kink pairs. The APD and kink energetics are elaborated in detail in the low-stress limit. In this limit, the calculated stress-dependent activation enthalpy for the lowest-energy kink pair agrees well with that currently used in mesoscale dislocation dynamics simulations to model the temperature-dependent singlecrystal yield stress. In the high-stress limit, the calculated Peierls stress displays a strong orientation dependence under pure shear and uniaxial loading conditions, with an antitwinning-twinning ratio of 2.29 for pure shear {\{}211{\}} {\'{a}}111{\~{n}} loading. {\textcopyright} 2001 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the recent research and development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs). HEAs are loosely defined as solid solution alloys that contain more than five principal elements in equal or near equal atomic percent (at.{\%}). The concept of high entropy introduces a new path of developing advanced materials with unique properties, which cannot be achieved by the conventional micro-alloying approach based on only one dominant element. Up to date, many HEAs with promising properties have been reported, e.g., high wear-resistant HEAs, Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti and Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti alloys; high-strength body-centered-cubic (BCC) AlCoCrFeNi HEAs at room temperature, and NbMoTaV HEA at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the general corrosion resistance of the Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeSi HEA is much better than that of the conventional 304-stainless steel. This paper first reviews HEA formation in relation to thermodynamics, kinetics, and processing. Physical, magnetic, chemical, and mechanical properties are then discussed. Great details are provided on the plastic deformation, fracture, and magnetization from the perspectives of crackling noise and Barkhausen noise measurements, and the analysis of serrations on stress-strain curves at specific strain rates or testing temperatures, as well as the serrations of the magnetization hysteresis loops. The comparison between conventional and high-entropy bulk metallic glasses is analyzed from the viewpoints of eutectic composition, dense atomic packing, and entropy of mixing. Glass forming ability and plastic properties of high-entropy bulk metallic glasses are also discussed. Modeling techniques applicable to HEAs are introduced and discussed, such as ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and CALPHAD modeling. Finally, future developments and potential new research directions for HEAs are proposed.},

abstract = {A general formalism for the description of configurational cluster functions in multicomponent systems is developed. The approach is based on the description of configurational cluster functions in terms of an orthogonal basis in the multidimensional space of discrete spin variables. The formalism is used to characterize the reduced density matrices (or cluster probability densities) and the free energy functional obtained in the Cluster Variation Method approximation. For the particular representation chosen, the expectation values of the base functions are the commonly used multisite correlation functions. The latter form an independent set of variational parameters for the free energy which, in general, facilitates the minimization procedure. A new interpretation of the Cluster Variation Method as a self-consistency relation on the renormalized cluster energies is also presented. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi Cantor alloy, a face-centered-cubic (FCC) single-phase high-entropy alloy (HEA), has attracted considerable attention owing to its high strength and good ductility over a wide temperature range. The mechanical performance of this alloy was improved by reducing the stacking fault energy (SFE) through composition modification, and thus, a series of near- or non-equiatomic HEAs that are stronger and more ductile than their predecessor have been developed. However, the plastic-deformation behavior and strengthening mechanisms have not yet been fully discovered. In this study, we investigated the yielding and hardening behaviors of the Cantor alloy and FCC-phase Co-rich HEAs with different SFEs by in situ neutron diffraction combined with the first-principles method and electron-microscopy characterizations. The Co-rich HEAs exhibited a higher intrinsic yield strength than the Cantor alloy, mainly because of the larger shear modulus or modulus misfit, and grain refinement being more effective in improving the yield strength of low-SFE HEAs. Furthermore, higher flow stresses and better ductility of the Co-rich HEAs are attributed to the greater dislocation density and a larger number of stacking faults, which enhanced the strain-hardening rate during tensile deformation. The low SFE promoted mechanical twinning, and martensitic transformation contributed to higher strain-hardening rates. The present study provides deep insight into the yielding and hardening of FCC-phase HEAs, the understanding of which is a prerequisite for developing high-performance materials.},

In this work, we propose a supercell model, in which every lattice site has similar local atomic environment, to describe the random distributions of the atomic species in HEAs. Using these supercells in combination with abinitio calculations, we investigate the local lattice distortion of refractory HEAs with body-centered-cubic structure and 3d HEAs with face-centered-cubic structure. Our results demonstrate that the local lattice distortion of the refractory HEAs is much more significant than that of the 3d HEAs. We show that the atomic size mismatch evaluated with the empirical atomic radii is not accurate enough to describe the local lattice distortion. Both the lattice distortion energy and the mixing entropy contribute significantly to the thermodynamic stability of HEAs. However the local lattice distortion has negligible effect on the equilibrium lattice parameter and bulk modulus.},

abstract = {Advanced machine learning methods could be useful to obtain novel insights into some challenging nanomechanical problems. In this work, we employed artificial neural networks to predict the fracture stress of defective graphene samples. First, shallow neural networks were used to predict the fracture stress, which depends on the temperature, vacancy concentration, strain rate, and loading direction. A part of the data required to model the shallow networks was obtained by developing an analytical solution based on the Bailey durability criterion and the Arrhenius equation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also used to obtain some data. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the features learnt by the neural network, and their behaviour under extrapolation was also investigated. Subsequently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to predict the fracture stress of graphene samples containing random distributions of vacancy defects. Data required to model CNNs was obtained from MD simulations. Our results reveal that the neural networks have a strong ability to predict the fracture stress of defective graphene under various processing conditions. In addition, this work highlights some advantages as well as limitations and challenges in using neural networks to solve complex problems in the domain of computational materials design.},

Here we propose a new interpretation for the two widely used $\delta$ and $\Omega$ empirical parameters. In this work, they are shown to be inaccurate when applied to a large group of RHEAs, but can be a powerful alloy design tool if applied on specific subsystems of alloys. Experimentally, chromium-containing alloys are shown to form Laves phases, especially when the lattice distortion ($\delta$) is high, while aluminum-containing alloys are shown to form the A15 phase upon heat-treatment, due to their highly negative enthalpy of mixing ($\Delta$Hmix). In addition to microstructural characterization, mechanical properties of these alloys via hardness testing were assessed. A poor correlation was observed between the hardness and the atomic size and elastic modulus mismatch in these single-phase BCC RHEAs, suggesting that core structure of the screw dislocations is a crucial parameter in understanding the strength of these alloys.},

The key advances of this technique are the ultrahigh scanning rate, which can be as high as 106 K/s, and the ultrahigh heat capacity sensitivity, with a resolution typically better than 1 nJ/K. Nanocalorimetry has attracted extensive attention in the field of materials science, where it is applied to perform quantitative analysis of rapid phase transitions. This paper reviews the development of nanocalorimetry over the last three decades and summarizes its applications to various materials ranging from polymers to metals. The glass transition and crystallization of non-crystalline materials, melting and solidification of metallic droplets, and solid-state phase transitions of thin films are introduced as typical examples. Furthermore, nanocalorimetry coupled with structural characterization techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, is presented. Finally, current challenges and future outlooks for the technique are discussed. Given the unique attributes of the technique, we expect nanocalorimetry to attract increasing attention, especially with regard to characterization of fast phase transitions and evaluation of size effects.},

abstract = {Pure tungsten and tungsten alloys with minor alloying additions are known to be brittle at room temperature and have high ductile-to-brittle transition temperatures (DBTT). Improving the ductility of tungsten can have significant impact on both the manufacturing of and the range of applications of tungsten. Although there has been a significant volume of reported research on improving the ductility of tungsten over the span of several decades, it remains a difficult challenge. This is at least partially attributable to the fact that the understanding on the mechanical properties of tungsten and their dependence on microstructure has been insufficient. This article attempts to offer a critical review of the methods that have been reported in the literature for improving the ductility of tungsten in order to understand the critical factors that control the ductility (or lack thereof) in tungsten. It is clear from the literature that all tungsten materials that have been reported to be ductile at room temperature, or to have drastically reduced DBTT, are the result of thermomechanically processed (TMP) material with deformed and textured microstructures. Alloying tungsten with rhenium is essentially the only known method to improve the ductility of tungsten by alloying (excluding the class of alloys known as heavy alloys which are composites of tungsten with nickel and iron). Although there have been a large number of research reports in recent years on the effect of additives, including oxides, carbides, and others, the results are inconclusive to date or insignificant with respect to the effects of those additives on the ductility of tungsten independent of the effects of thermomechanical working. Using ultrafine-grained or nanocrystalline microstructure to improve the ductility of tungsten is another approach that has appeared promising. However, the results to date have not shown that the ductility of tungsten can be improved by reducing the grain size alone, without the benefits of thermomechanical processed or deformed microstructures. Another objective of this review is to examine the correlation between the ductility of tungsten and different microstructures resulting from different processing methods and compositions.},

abstract = {The microstructure, thermal and mechanical stability of Ni-based single crystalline superalloys depend strongly on the alloying elements and their concentrations. Alloying has been the main design strategy for stabilizing the compositions, microstructures and thermal-mechanical properties. This article presents a review on the effects of some common alloying elements on the microstructural and mechanical property stability control of Ni-based superalloys. The various alloying elements are divided into four categories according to their main effects on these properties, comprising base elements, mechanical strengthening elements, long term stability elements and the oxidation resistance elements. The mechanical strengthening elements can further be divided into precipitation, solid solution and grain boundary segregation elements. The precipitation elements strengthen the alloys by forming the L12 structured $\gamma$ʹ phase. The solid solution elements strengthen primarily the $\gamma$ phase, by increasing the solidus temperatures and decreasing the stacking fault energy, which in turn influences the thermal stability of the phases and the resistance of dislocation movement. The grain boundary elements strengthen the alloys by the formation of carbides and borides along the grain boundaries during solidification, which help to prevent the formation of casting pores and hot tearing and to strengthen low angle boundaries. The long-term stability elements inhibit the precipitation of topologically closed-packed phases causing deterioration of the mechanical properties. The oxidation resistance element, mainly Al, promotes the formation of protective Al2O3 surface layer.},

Here, we adopt a local structure approach based on the atomic pair distribution function measurements in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate a series of BCC RMPEAs. Our results demonstrate that all the analyzed RMPEAs exhibit local lattice distortions (LLD) to some extent, but a severe LLD, a breakdown of the 15{\%} atomic size difference in Hume-Rothery rules, occurs only in the Zr- and/or Hf-containing RMPEAs. In addition, through the DFT calculations we show that charge transfer among the elements profoundly reduces the size mismatch effect in average to stabilize this energy-unfavorable severe LLD. The observed competitive coexistence between LLD and charge transfer demonstrates the importance of the electronic effects on the local environments in RMPEAs.},

abstract = {The traditional methods for predicting the occurrence of deleterious topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in Ni-based superalloys have been based on the PHACOMP and newPHACOMP methodologies. These schemes use the average number of holes Nh or the centre of gravity of the elemental d-bands Md to predict whether or not a given multicomponent alloy will be prone to TCP formation. However, as both these one-dimensional methodologies are well-known to fail with respect to new generations of alloys, a novel two-dimensional structure map (N,$\Delta$V/V) is introduced where N is the average electron concentration and $\Delta$V/V is a composition-dependent size-factor difference. This map is found to separate the experimental data on the TCP phases of binary A-B transition metal alloys into well-defined but sometimes overlapping regions corresponding to different structure types such as A15, $\sigma$, $\chi$, R, P, $\delta$, $\mu$, M and Laves. Detailed investigations of ternary phase diagrams and multicomponent systems show that TCP phases, regardless of the number of constituents, are located in the same regions of the structure map that are favoured by the binary compounds of the same structure type. The structure map is then used in conjunction with CALPHAD computations of $\sigma$ phase stability to show that the predictive power of newPHACOMP for the seven component Ni-Co-Cr-Ta-W-Re-Al system studied recently by Reed et al. [24] is indeed poor. This supports a growing consensus that robust methods of TCP phase prediction in multicomponent alloys will require the inclusion of reliable first-principles thermodynamic databases within the semi-empirical CALPHAD scheme. {\textcopyright} 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {The objective of this work is to provide an overview of the evolution of phase transformations in AlCrFeMnMo high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a recently proposed family showing great promises in metallurgical industry for coating applications. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations based on ab initio energy parameters, to analyze the order/disorder transition and the phase separation process from the high-temperature A2 single phase. The reliability of the atomic-scale approach, already known to work on AlCoCrFeNi, is first confirmed on AlCrFeMnNi, the presence of A2-(Cr,Fe,Mn) and B2-(Al,Ni) being in good agreement with previous experimental studies. However, simulations of equimolar AlCrFeMnMo show that the A2 solid solution should transform into two B2 phases at ambient temperature, instead of a couple of A2 phases observed experimentally. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Increasing iron and decreasing molybdenum contents in AlCrFeMnMo favors ordering for chromium and phase change for aluminum, without changing the conclusion on A2 / B2 competition previously drawn from the equimolar case.},

abstract = {Oxygen is always a constituent in “real” titanium alloys including titanium alloy powders used for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM). In addition, oxygen uptake during powder handling and printing is hard to control and, hence, it is important to understand and predict how oxygen is affecting the microstructure. Therefore, oxygen is included in the evaluation of the thermodynamic properties of the titanium-vanadium system employing the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams method and a complete model of the O-Ti-V system is presented. The $\beta$-transus temperature is calculated to increase with increasing oxygen content whereas the extension of the $\alpha$-Ti phase field into the binary is calculated to decrease, which explains the low vanadium solubilities measured in some experimental works. In addition, the critical temperature of the metastable miscibility gap of the $\beta$-phase is calculated to increase to above room temperature when oxygen is added. The effects of oxygen additions on phase fractions, martensite and $\omega$ formation temperatures are discussed, along with the impacts these changes may have on AM of titanium alloys.},

abstract = {We report the stacking fault energy (SFE) for a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) equiatomic concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs) derived as subsystems from the NiCoFeCrMn and NiCoFeCrPd high entropy alloys based on ab initio calculations. At low temperatures, these CSAs display very low even negative SFEs, indicating that hexagonal close-pack (hcp) is more energy favorable than fcc structure. The temperature dependence of SFE for some CSAs is studied. With increasing temperature, a hcp-to-fcc transition is revealed for those CSAs with negative SFEs, which can be attributed to the role of intrinsic vibrational entropy. The analysis of the vibrational modes suggests that the vibrational entropy arises from the high frequency states in the hcp structure that originate from local vibrational mode. Our results underscore the importance of vibrational entropy in determining the temperature dependence of SFE for CSAs.},

abstract = {Over last 15 years high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) have gained much appreciation for their numerous superior properties. In this paper we have shown a novel simulation methodology to realistically predict the nanometer level local structural features of complex Ta0.25Nb0.25Hf0.25Zr0.25 HEA. This involves prediction of the morphology of the short-range clustering (SRCs), their quantitative atomic composition at the nano level and the thermodynamic aspects. An alloy structure model containing 11664 atoms was created and this was subjected to structure evolution at 1800 °C. The structure evolution technique is based on a combined hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) approach. The simulated results from this work are further validated against experiments and material characterizations reported in literature and done by high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM) for the nano-level microstructure, atom probe tomography (APT) for the local chemical compositions and X-ray diffraction at synchrotron sources for the local lattice relaxation effects. This work qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the materials characterization results reasonably well from the developed simulation methodologies. The structure evolution methods as described in this work are based on independent computer simulations and does not involve any manual intervention for input based on experiments on evolving SRCs. This work shows the potential of utilizing MC/MD based computational methods to reduce the number of costly experimental characterizations and accelerate the pace for materials development.},

In each Newton step an approximate solution for the linearized problem is computed with the conjugate gradient method as an inner iteration. The conjugate gradient iteration is terminated when the residual has been reduced to a prescribed percentage. Under certain assumptions on the nonlinear operator it is shown that the algorithm converges and is stable if the discrepancy principle is used to terminate the outer iteration. These assumptions are fulfilled, e.g., for the inverse problem of identifying the diffusion coefficient in a parabolic differential equation from distributed data.},

abstract = {The traditional methods for predicting the occurrence of deleterious topologically close-packed (TCP) phases in Ni-based superalloys have been based on the PHACOMP and newPHACOMP methodologies. These schemes use the average number of holes Nh or the centre of gravity of the elemental d-bands Md to predict whether or not a given multicomponent alloy will be prone to TCP formation. However, as both these one-dimensional methodologies are well-known to fail with respect to new generations of alloys, a novel two-dimensional structure map (N,$\Delta$V/V) is introduced where N is the average electron concentration and $\Delta$V/V is a composition-dependent size-factor difference. This map is found to separate the experimental data on the TCP phases of binary A-B transition metal alloys into well-defined but sometimes overlapping regions corresponding to different structure types such as A15, $\sigma$, $\chi$, R, P, $\delta$, $\mu$, M and Laves. Detailed investigations of ternary phase diagrams and multicomponent systems show that TCP phases, regardless of the number of constituents, are located in the same regions of the structure map that are favoured by the binary compounds of the same structure type. The structure map is then used in conjunction with CALPHAD computations of $\sigma$ phase stability to show that the predictive power of newPHACOMP for the seven component Ni-Co-Cr-Ta-W-Re-Al system studied recently by Reed et al. [24] is indeed poor. This supports a growing consensus that robust methods of TCP phase prediction in multicomponent alloys will require the inclusion of reliable first-principles thermodynamic databases within the semi-empirical CALPHAD scheme. {\textcopyright} 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {The microstructure, thermal and mechanical stability of Ni-based single crystalline superalloys depend strongly on the alloying elements and their concentrations. Alloying has been the main design strategy for stabilizing the compositions, microstructures and thermal-mechanical properties. This article presents a review on the effects of some common alloying elements on the microstructural and mechanical property stability control of Ni-based superalloys. The various alloying elements are divided into four categories according to their main effects on these properties, comprising base elements, mechanical strengthening elements, long term stability elements and the oxidation resistance elements. The mechanical strengthening elements can further be divided into precipitation, solid solution and grain boundary segregation elements. The precipitation elements strengthen the alloys by forming the L12 structured $\gamma$ʹ phase. The solid solution elements strengthen primarily the $\gamma$ phase, by increasing the solidus temperatures and decreasing the stacking fault energy, which in turn influences the thermal stability of the phases and the resistance of dislocation movement. The grain boundary elements strengthen the alloys by the formation of carbides and borides along the grain boundaries during solidification, which help to prevent the formation of casting pores and hot tearing and to strengthen low angle boundaries. The long-term stability elements inhibit the precipitation of topologically closed-packed phases causing deterioration of the mechanical properties. The oxidation resistance element, mainly Al, promotes the formation of protective Al2O3 surface layer.},

abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as a promising class of equiatomic or near equiatomic multicomponent alloys, which garner fundamental curiosities and interest in high temperature applications. Understanding diffusion kinetics of HEAs is critical to assess their phase stability and deformation behaviour, particularly at elevated temperatures. For the first time, bulk tracer diffusion coefficients of Co, Cr, Fe and Mn are determined in polycrystalline CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs using the radiotracer method in the temperature interval of 1073–1373 K. Material homogeneity and the absence of any phase decomposition in CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs were established by electron microscopy and atom probe tomography investigations. Both bulk and grain boundary diffusion contributions to penetration profiles are observed for diffusion of Co, Cr, Fe and Mn tracers in both HEAs. The temperature dependencies of bulk diffusion for all tracers show Arrhenius behaviour. The corresponding activation energies (Q) and the logarithm of pre-exponential factors (D0) show a linear relationship, thus following the “compensation rule”. An increase of the configurational entropy leads to reduced diffusion rates only when a homologous temperature scale is used for comparison. The increase of activation energy barrier and lower frequency factors both contribute to the decreased diffusion rates. A cross-over temperature (Tc = 1020 K) is observed for Co diffusion (on slight extrapolation of Arrhenius plot) in CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs, while Cr and Fe exhibit almost parallel Arrhenius lines. Above Tc, the Co diffusivity is higher in CoCrFeMnNi than in CoCrFeNi, which suggests that diffusion in HEAs need not be assumed to retard with an increasing number of elements. The existence of a cross-over temperature correlates with the change in binding energy (or enthalpy) of the constituents from CoCrFeNi to CoCrFeMnNi.},

abstract = {Transition metal elements, alloys, and intermetallic compounds often adopt the body centered cubic (bcc) and face centered cubic (fcc) structures. By comparing quantitative density functional with qualitative tight-binding calculations, we analyze the electronic factors which make the bcc and fcc structures energetically favorable. To do so, we develop a tight-binding function, $\Delta$Estar, a function that measures the energetic effects of transferring electrons within wave vector stars. This function allows one to connect distortions in solids to the Jahn-Teller effect in molecules and to provide an orbital perspective on structure determining deformations in alloys. We illustrate its use by considering first a two-dimensional square net. We then turn to three-dimensional fcc and bcc structures, and distortions of these. Using $\Delta$Estar, we rationalize the differences in energy of these structures. We are able to deduce which orbitals are responsible for instabilities in seven to nine valence electron per atom (e-/a) bcc systems and five and six e-/a fcc structures. Finally we demonstrate that these results account for the bcc and fcc type structures found in both the elements and binary intermetallic compounds of group 4 through 9 transition metal atoms. The outline of a theory of metal structure deformations based on loss of point group operation rather than translational symmetry is presented.},

abstract = {This study shows that entropy is not a physical quantity, that is, the physical quantity called "entropy" does not exist. If the efficiency of a heat engine is defined as $\eta$=W/W1, and the reversible cycle is considered to be the Stirling cycle, then, given ∮ dQ/T=0, we can prove ∮ dW/T=0 and ∮ dE/T=0: If ∮ dQ/T=0, ∮ dW/T=0, and ∮ dE/T=0 are thought to define new system-state variables, such definitions would be absurd. The fundamental error of entropy is that in any reversible process, the polytropic process function Q is not a single-valued function of T, and the key step of ∑[=($\Delta$Q)/T] to ∫ dQ/T doesn't hold. Similarly, ∮ dQ/T=0, ∮ dW/T=0, and ∮ dE/T=0 do not hold, either. Because the absolute entropy of Boltzmann is used to explain Clausius entropy, and the unit (J=K) of the former is transformed from the latter, the nonexistence of Clausius entropy simultaneously denies Boltzmann entropy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Physics Essays Publication.},

But much of the existing understanding of point defects that play a significant role in the mechanical properties of titanium is based on semi-empirical rules. In this work, we present the results of a detailed self-consistent first-principles study that was developed to determine formation energies of intrinsic point defects including vacancies, self-interstitials, and extrinsic point defects, such as, interstitial and substitutional impurities/dopants. We find that most elements, regardless of size, prefer substitutional positions, but highly electronegative elements, such as C, N, O, F, S, and Cl, some of which are common impurities in Ti, occupy interstitial positions.},

The effects of these energy fluctuations on the strengthening are studied using dislocation dynamics simulations that track the evolution of partial dislocations in FCC metals at zero temperature. Different values of the intrinsic stacking fault energy are assigned to regions with size in the range of 0.5 nm–12 nm in the slip plane, while the other mechanical properties are left constant. A theoretical model is derived and compared to the simulation results. In the model and the simulations the predicted value of the yield stress grows with larger fluctuations of the stacking fault energy. Furthermore, a strong size dependency is observed, with a maximum in the strength attained when the mean region size approaches the average equilibrium stacking fault width. In summary, the strength of high entropy alloys can be improved by introducing disorder in the chemical misfit with a characteristic length scale of the order of the average stacking fault width.},

abstract = {Refractory high entropy alloys feature outstanding properties making them a promising materials class for next-generation higherature applications. At high temperatures, materials properties are strongly affected by lattice vibrations (phonons). Phonons critically influence thermal stability, thermodynamic and elastic properties, as well as thermal conductivity. In contrast to perfect crystals and ordered alloys, the inherently present mass and force constant fluctuations in multi-component random alloys (high entropy alloys) can induce significant phonon scattering and broadening. Despite their importance, phonon scattering and broadening have so far only scarcely been investigated for high entropy alloys. We tackle this challenge from a theoretical perspective and employ ab initio calculations to systematically study the impact of force constant and mass fluctuations on the phonon spectral functions of 12 body-centered cubic random alloys, from binaries up to 5-component high entropy alloys, addressing the key question of how chemical complexity impacts phonons. We find that it is crucial to include both mass and force constant fluctuations. If one or the other is neglected, qualitatively wrong results can be obtained such as artificial phonon band gaps. We analyze how the results obtained for the phonons translate into thermodynamically integrated quantities, specifically the vibrational entropy. Changes in the vibrational entropy with increasing the number of elements can be as large as changes in the configurational entropy and are thus important for phase stability considerations. The set of studied alloys includes MoTa, MoTaNb, MoTaNbW, MoTaNbWV, VW, VWNb, VWTa, VWNbTa, VTaNbTi, VWNbTaTi, HfZrNb, HfMoTaTiZr.},

None of the 24 type strains tested showed growth on or degradation of this substrate, indicating that none of the strains synthesized and secreted starch-degrading enzymes. Introducing the Streptomyces griseus amy gene on an expression vector into the lysine-producer C. glutamicum DM1730, we constructed a C. glutamicum strain synthesizing and secreting alpha-amylase into the culture broth. Although some high-molecular-weight degradation products remained in the culture broth, this recombinant strain effectively used soluble starch as carbon and energy substrate for growth and also for lysine production. Thus, employment of our construct allows avoidance of the cost-intensive enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch, which commercially is used as a substrate in industrial amino acid fermentations.},

abstract = {Dislocations and stacking faults are important crystal defects, because they strongly influence material properties. As of now, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the most frequently used technique to study the properties of single dislocations and stacking faults. Specifically, the Burgers vector b of dislocations or displacement vector R of stacking faults can be determined on the basis of the g{\textperiodcentered}b = n (g{\textperiodcentered}R = n) criterion by setting up different two-beam diffraction conditions with an imaging vector g. Based on the reciprocity theorem, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) can also be applied for defect characterization, but has been less frequently used up to now. In this work, we demonstrate g{\textperiodcentered}b = n (g{\textperiodcentered}R = n) analyses of dislocations and stacking faults in GaN by STEM imaging in a scanning electron microscope. The instrument is equipped with a STEM detector, double-tilt TEM specimen holder, and a charge-coupled-device camera for the acquisition of on-axis diffraction patterns. The latter two accessories are mandatory to control the specimen orientation, which has not been possible before in a scanning electron microscope.

We proposed some novel ideas of explaining hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms of the studied material in regard to two cracking morphologies: transgranular and intergranular cracking. It is for the first time to report that electrochemical charging alone could cause slip lines, surface and subsurface cracks on nickel-based superalloys. The formation of pre-damages was discussed by calculating the hydrogen concentration gradient and the internal stress generated during cathodic charging. Pre-damages were proved to result in transgranular cracks and lead to the evident reduction of mechanical properties. In addition, the STRONG (Slip Transfer Resistance of Neighbouring Grains) model was used to analyze the dependence of hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking on the microscopic incompatibility of the grain boundaries. The results show that in the presence of hydrogen, grain boundaries with a lower dislocation slip transmission are more prone to cracking during loading and vice versa.},

While grain boundary engineering has been applied to mitigate this issue, ambiguity in the mechanisms behind hydrogen embrittlement leads to ambiguity in the mechanism by which grain boundary engineering helps to mitigate this problem. In this study, grain boundary engineering was applied to improve resistance to hydrogen embrittlement in Custom Age 625 PLUS{\textregistered}, an alloy frequently used in corrosive environments where hydrogen embrittlement is of particular concern. Iterative low strain cold rolling followed by annealing at intermediate temperature successfully produced a grain boundary engineered microstructure with large twin-related domains and a high fraction of interconnected coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries. Rising step load testing demonstrated that grain boundary engineering increased the stress intensity at which failure from hydrogen embrittlement occurred and caused a shift from intergranular to transgranular crack propagation. Evidence of localized plasticity on fracture surfaces suggest that hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) is the dominant mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement.},

abstract = {A new method of approximation for order-disorder phenomena is developed. In Sec. A, the method is explained for the one-dimensional Ising lattice. Sections B and C cover the approximations already known, such as those of Bethe (Sec. B) and of Kramers-Wannier (Sec. C), which are shown to be derived as special cases of the method with suitable choices of variables. In Sec. D, an improved treatment is explained for the three-dimensional simple cubic Ising lattice. This approximation is found to agree with the rigorous expansion of the partition function up to the fourth moment by Kirkwood's moment method, so far as the disordered state is concerned. In Sec. E the general formula for the entropy is given. In Sec. H an improved treatment of the face-centered lattice (Ising model) is given. {\textcopyright} 1951 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a new class of random alloys having impressive strength and toughness. Here, a mechanistic, parameter-free, and predictive theory for the temperature-, composition-, and strain-rate-dependence of the plastic yield strength of fcc HEAs is presented, validated, and applied to understand recent experiments. To first order, each elemental component in the HEA is considered as a solute embedded in the effective matrix of the surrounding alloy. Strengthening is then mainly achieved due to dislocation interactions with the random local concentration fluctuations around the average composition. The theory is validated against molecular simulations on model Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Hall-Petch-corrected yield strengths in Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Mn fcc HEAs are then predicted using only available experimental information, and good quantitative agreement is achieved. The theory demonstrates the origins of the high strength and detailed trends with composition, materials parameters, temperature, thus identifying the key measurable/calculable material properties needed for design and optimization of fcc HEAs, and is a general model for fcc random alloys.},

abstract = {Europe is entering a new age where it faces many challenges such as globalisation, a financial system in need of reform, climate change and an increasing scarcity of resources. This is why the European air transport system is directly concerned by new challenges regarding its competitiveness, performance and sustainability. The European manufacturing and service industry is strongly affected by globalisation, new competitors, new markets and the need for innovation. Sustainable mobility is at stake, as are millions of jobs and billions of Euros of added value. Research and innovation are key to maintaining Europe's capacities and competitiveness and it is time to align efforts towards a new long-term vision for this sector. We invited key stakeholders of European aviation from the aeronautics industry, air traffic management, airports, airlines, energy providers and the research community to come together in a High Level Group to develop a vision for Europe's aviation system and industry by 2050. The aviation community responded enthusiastically and produced this important document which focuses on two main challenges: meeting the needs of our citizens and the market as well as maintaining global leadership. The strategy addresses customer orientation and market needs as well as industrial competitiveness and the need to maintain an adequate skills and research infrastructure base in Europe. By 2050, passengers and freight should enjoy efficient and seamless travel services, based on a resilient air transport system thoroughly integrated with other transport modes and well connected to the rest of the world. This will be necessary in order to meet the growing demand for travel and to cope more easily with unforeseeable events. It should also help to reduce aviation's impact on citizens and the environment. Aviation has an important role to play in reducing noise as well as greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of traffic growth. Aviation must move towards more sustainable energy sources. It should live up to the highest levels of safety and security to ensure that passengers and freight as well as the air transport system and its infrastructure are protected. The vision set out in this document stresses the need for an innovation friendly environment relying on strong, sustainable and coherent investment in research and innovation and enhanced governance, funding and financing structures. Research, technology and innovation are essential catalysts for a competitive and sustainable future and we need to start quickly to be effective. This document setting out a European vision for the future of aviation emphasises where those working in aviation see the priorities for the relevant policy, research and innovation instruments. It is a high-level vision of Europe leading with an aviation industry that is clean, competitive, safe and secure.},

abstract = {The unique and unanticipated properties of multiple principal component alloys have reinvigorated the field of alloy design and drawn strong interest across scientific disciplines. The vast compositional parameter space makes these alloys a unique area of exploration by means of computational design. However, as of now a method to compute efficiently, yet with high accuracy the thermodynamic properties of such alloys has been missing. One of the underlying reasons is the lack of accurate and efficient approaches to compute vibrational free energies—including anharmonicity—for these chemically complex multicomponent alloys. In this work, a density-functional-theory based approach to overcome this issue is developed based on a combination of thermodynamic integration and a machine-learning potential. We demonstrate the performance of the approach by computing the anharmonic free energy of the prototypical five-component VNbMoTaW refractory high entropy alloy.},

abstract = {Large strain warm deformation at different temperatures and subsequent intercritical annealing has been applied to obtain fine grained (2.4$\mu$m) and ultrafine grained (1.2$\mu$m) ferrite/martensite dual-phase (DP) steels. Their mechanical properties were tested under tensile and impact conditions and compared to a hot deformed coarse grained (12.4$\mu$m) reference material. Both yield strength and tensile strength follow a Hall-Petch type linear relationship, whereas uniform elongation and total elongation are hardly affected by grain refinement. The initial strain hardening rate as well as the post-uniform elongation increase with decreasing grain size. Ductile fracture mechanisms are considerably promoted due to grain refinement. Grain refinement further lowers the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature and leads to higher absorbed impact energies. Besides the common correlations with the ferrite grain size, these phenomena are explained in terms of the martensite particle size, shape and distribution and the more homogeneous dislocation distribution in ultrafine ferrite grains. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study shows that entropy is not a physical quantity, that is, the physical quantity called "entropy" does not exist. If the efficiency of a heat engine is defined as $\eta$=W/W1, and the reversible cycle is considered to be the Stirling cycle, then, given ∮ dQ/T=0, we can prove ∮ dW/T=0 and ∮ dE/T=0: If ∮ dQ/T=0, ∮ dW/T=0, and ∮ dE/T=0 are thought to define new system-state variables, such definitions would be absurd. The fundamental error of entropy is that in any reversible process, the polytropic process function Q is not a single-valued function of T, and the key step of ∑[=($\Delta$Q)/T] to ∫ dQ/T doesn't hold. Similarly, ∮ dQ/T=0, ∮ dW/T=0, and ∮ dE/T=0 do not hold, either. Because the absolute entropy of Boltzmann is used to explain Clausius entropy, and the unit (J=K) of the former is transformed from the latter, the nonexistence of Clausius entropy simultaneously denies Boltzmann entropy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Physics Essays Publication.},

This article examines both traditional and emerging technologies, including the production of powder, and the sintering, microstructure, and mechanical properties of PM Ti. The production methods of powder are classified into two categories: (1) powder that is produced as the product of extractive metallurgy processes, and (2) powder that is made from Ti sponge, ingot, mill products, or scrap. A new hydrogen-assisted magnesium reduction (HAMR) process is also discussed. The mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V produced using various PM processes are analyzed based on their dependence on unique microstructural features, oxygen content, porosity, and grain size. In particular, the fatigue properties of PM Ti-6Al-4V are examined as functions of microstructure. A hydrogen-enabled approach for microstructural engineering that can be used to produce PM Ti with wrought-like microstructure and properties is also presented.

Using two theoretical models, the variation in the width of peaks in the pair distribution function (PDF) with changes in composition, ordering and atomic radius is presented. Key practical considerations for the successful analysis of local lattice strains using this technique are discussed, with particular reference to sample preparation, instrumental and data processing effects. Further, the mitigation of errors in local-strain measurements caused by differences in the scattering length of constituent atoms is presented.

abstract = {The formation energy of a solid surface can be extracted from slab calculations if the bulk energy per atom is known. It has been pointed out previously that the resulting surface energy will diverge with slab thickness if the bulk energy is in error, in the context of calculations which used different methods to study the bulk and slab systems. We show here that this result is equally relevant for state-of-the-an computational methods which carefully treat bulk and slab systems in the same way. Here we compare different approaches, and present a solution to the problem that eliminates the divergence and leads to rapidly convergent and accurate surface energies.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the mechanical properties and fracture behavior of newly developed body-centered-cubic-structured TiTaHfNb, TiTaHfNbZr and TiTaHfMoZr high entropy alloys (HEAs) under impact loading as part of an effort to evaluate their potential utility as implant materials. The experimental findings showed all three Ti-based HEAs have lower Young's modulus as compared to the conventionally used implant materials. Fractography analysis revealed that the TiTaHfNb HEA demonstrated significant ductility with the highest energy absorption capacity, while the TiTaHfNbZr and the TiTaHfMoZr alloys exhibited mixed mode fracture with relatively low ductility. Specifically, the reduction of ductility and energy absorption capacity under impact loading was attributed to the addition of Zr and Mo into Ti-based HEA system, which facilitates formation of additional dislocations in the microstructure due to increased lattice distortion. The current findings demonstrate that, from a mechanical point of view, the TiTaHfNb HEA could be considered as an alternative implant material for applications demanding high wear and corrosion resistance, such as hip or knee implants, and thus, warrant further investigation of the biomedical performance of this alloy.},

Numerous studies have shown that alloy 718 may be sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement. In the present study, the susceptibilities of three distinct metallurgical states of alloy 718 to hydrogen embrittlement were investigated to identify both the effect of hydrogen trapping on hydrogen embrittlement and the role of temperature in the hydrogen-trapping mechanism. Cathodic charging in a molten salt bath was used to saturate the different hydrogen traps of each metallurgical state. Tensile tests at different temperatures and different strain rates were carried out to study the effect of hydrogen on mechanical properties and failure modes, in combination with hydrogen content measurements. The results demonstrated that Ni-based superalloy 718 was strongly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement between 25. °C and 300. °C, and highlighted the dominant roles played by the hydrogen solubility and the hydrogen trapping on mechanical behavior and fracture modes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Valence electron concentration (VEC) was treated as a useful parameter to predict the stability of solid solution phases. However, the available experimental data to support this criterion is far from enough. In the current study, the high-throughput ab initio modeling is applied to investigate the relative stability of FCC and BCC single crystals of the Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni high entropy alloys (HEAs) by using the special quasi-random structure (SQS) approach. The predictions start with pure elements of the Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni system and are continued with binaries, ternaries, and quaternary compositions, which come up with 180 compositions (360 structures). After that, the reliability of the VEC criterion is testified. The results show that the VEC criterion not only works for the stable structure but also works effectively for metastable structure when both FCC and BCC are not thermodynamic stable. However, it is found that the old VEC criterion proposed by Guo et al. fails to work effectively for compositions containing high concentrations of light-weight metals such as Al at VEC{\textless} 5. To solve this problem, the present work proposed a new VEC rule to define the stability of FCC and BCC structures at the ground state. With the implementation of the new VEC rule, the effectiveness of the VEC rule (EVEC) of both FCC and BCC structures is enhanced, especially for pure elements and binary compositions, indicating that this rule does not only work effectively for multicomponent systems but also works for low-order systems.},

abstract = {In this study, friction and wear of a body-centered cubic equiatomic TiZrHfNb high-entropy (HE) alloy were investigated using a nanoscratch method. Scratch tests, under both ramping and constant load modes, were conducted to evaluate the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear rate of the alloy. The effects of scratch rate on the friction and wear were also studied. The morphology such as the surface profile and depth of scratched tracks was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). It was found that, whilst wear behavior, including wear rate and wear resistance, could be described by Archard equation, friction of the alloy appeared to be more complicated. Experimental results revealed that the friction of the alloy could be divided into two distinct regimes - elastic and plastic. The COF decreased rapidly with increasing normal load in the elastic regime, but became essentially constant in the plastic regime, indicating a transition of friction mechanism. In this study, scratch tests were also performed on pure Nb and a solid-solution strengthened Nb-based C103 alloy to make a direct comparison. The TiZrHfNb HE alloy apparently exhibited an improved wear resistance and lower COF as compared to its traditional alloy counterparts. The better wear resistance and lower COF were discussed in lights of the acting plowing and adhesion mechanisms during wear.},

abstract = {The studies following HEA inceptions were apparently motivated to search for singlephase solid solution over intermetallic phases, accordingly made possible by the concept of high configurational entropy. However, it was realised that the formation of intermetallic phases in HEAs is prevalent due to other criterions that determine stable phases. Nonetheless, recent efforts have been directed towards attributes of microstructural combinations. In this viewpoint, the techniques used to predict microstructural features and methods of microstructural characterisation are elucidated in HESA fields. The study further analyses shortcomings regarding the design approaches of HESAs. A brief history is given into how HESAs were developed since their birth, to emphasize the evaluation techniques used to elucidate high temperature properties of HESAs, and the incentive thereof that enabled further pursuit of HESAs in the direction of optimal microstructure and composition. The theoretical models of strengthening mechanisms in HEAs are explained. The impact of processing route on the HESAs performance is analysed from previous studies. Thereafter, the future of HESAs in the market is conveyed from scientific opinion. Previous designs of HEAs/HESAs were more based on evaluation experiments, which lead to an extended period of research and considerable use of resources; currently, more effort is directed towards computational and theoretical methods to accelerate the exploration of huge HEA composition space.},

Two alloys were then selected for production by industrial processes and patented as SMO43 and SMO48. After thermomechanical treatments, the microstructural features and the mechanical properties of these two alloys were thoroughly evaluated. Tensile strength, LCF and FCG behaviours prove to be at least as good as N18's and creep strengths significantly higher. Finally, SMO43 appears to better fulfil the selection criteria.},

All rights reserved.Recent multi-principal element, high entropy alloy (HEA) development strategies vastly expand the number of candidate alloy systems, but also pose a new challenge - how to rapidly screen thousands of candidate alloy systems for targeted properties. Here we develop a new approach to rapidly assess structural metals by combining calculated phase diagrams with simple rules based on the phases present, their transformation temperatures and useful microstructures. We evaluate over 130,000 alloy systems, identifying promising compositions for more time-intensive experimental studies. We find the surprising result that solid solution alloys become less likely as the number of alloy elements increases. This contradicts the major premise of HEAs - that increased configurational entropy increases the stability of disordered solid solution phases. As the number of elements increases, the configurational entropy rises slowly while the probability of at least one pair of elements favouring formation of intermetallic compounds increases more rapidly, explaining this apparent contradiction.},

@article{JenniferAnneHaley2001,
abstract = {This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.},

Through correlative electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, we captured a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) and its associated moving leading partial dislocation (LPD). The structure and composition of these imperfections reveal characteristic chemical – structural contrast. The SISF locally exhibits a D019 ordered structure coherently embedded in the L12 $\gamma$′ and enriched in W and Co. Interestingly, the LPD is enriched with Cr and Co, while the adjoining planes ahead of the LPD are enriched with Al.

abstract = {Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are promising candidates for new-generation high temperature materials, but they generally suffer from room temperature brittleness and unsatisfactory high-temperature oxidation resistance. There currently lack efforts to address to these two critical issues for RHEAs at the same time. In this work, the high temperature oxidation resistance of a previously identified ductile Hf0.5Nb0.5Ta0.5Ti1.5Zr RHEA is studied. An accelerated oxidation or more specifically, pesting, in the temperature range of 600–1000 °C is observed for the target RHEA, where the oxidation leads the material to catastrophically disintegrate into powders. The pesting mechanism is studied here, and is attributed to the failure in forming protective oxide scales accompanied by the accelerated internal oxidation. The simultaneous removal of zirconium and hafnium can eliminate the pesting phenomenon in the alloy. It is believed that pesting can also occur to other equiatomic and non-equiatomic quinary Hf-Nb-Ta-Ti-Zr or quaternary Hf-Nb-Ti-Zr and Hf-Ta-Ti-Zr RHEAs, where all currently available ductile RHEAs are identified. Therefore, the results from this work will provide crucial perspectives to the further development of RHEAs as novel high-temperature materials, with balanced room-temperature ductility and high-temperature oxidation resistance.},

abstract = {The elastic energy of mixing for multi-component solid solutions is derived by generalizing Eshelby's sphere-in-hole model. By surveying the dependence of the elastic energy on the chemical composition and lattice misfit, we derive a lattice strain coefficient $\lambda$*. Studying several high-entropy alloys and superalloys, we propose that most solid solution multi-component alloys are stable when $\lambda$*{\textless}0.16, generalizing the Hume-Rothery atomic-size rule for binary alloys. We also reveal that the polydispersity index $\delta$, frequently used for describing strain in multi-component alloys, directly represents the elastic energy (e) with e=q$\delta$2, q being an elastic constant. Furthermore, the effects of (i) the number and (ii) the atomic-size distribution of constituting elements on the phase stability of high-entropy alloys were quantified. The present derivations and discussions open for richer considerations of elastic effects in high-entropy alloys, offering immediate support for quantitative assessments of their thermodynamic properties and studying related strengthening mechanisms.},

The two power series for X at extreme temperatures are used as a test for this and various other approximations, and it is found that the new result is a con- siderable improvement over the existing solutions.

A phenomenological correlation by Pugh between metal brittleness and its shear modulus to bulk modulus ratio was established more than 60 years ago. Nearly four decades later Pettifor conducted a quantum mechanical analysis of bond hybridization in a series of intermetallics and derived a separate ductility criterion based on the difference between two single-crystal elastic constants, C12–C44. In this paper, we discover the link between these two criteria and show that they are identical for materials with cubic crystal structures.},

abstract = {An optimal integration of modern computational tools and efficient experimentation is presented for the accelerated design of Nb-based superalloys. Integrated within a systems engineering framework, we have used ab initio methods along with alloy theory tools to predict phase stability of solid solutions and intermetallics to accelerate assessment of thermodynamic and kinetic databases enabling comprehensive predictive design of multicomponent multiphase microstructures as dynamic systems. Such an approach is also applicable for the accelerated design and development of other high performance materials. Based on established principles underlying Ni-based superalloys, the central microstructural concept is a precipitation strengthened system in which coherent cubic aluminide phase(s) provide both creep strengthening and a source of Al for Al2O3 passivation enabled by a Nb-based alloy matrix with required ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, atomic transport kinetics and oxygen solubility behaviors. Ultrasoft and PAW pseudopotentials, as implemented in VASP, are used to calculate total energy, density of states and bonding charge densities of aluminides with B2 and L21 structures relevant to this research. Characterization of prototype alloys by transmission and analytical electron microscopy demonstrates the precipitation of B2 or L21 aluminide in a (Nb) matrix. Employing Thermo-Calc and DICTRA software systems, thermodynamic and kinetic databases are developed for substitutional alloying elements and interstitial oxygen to enhance the diffusivity ratio of Al to O for promotion of Al2O3 passivation. However, the oxidation study of a Nb-Hf-Al alloy, with enhanced solubility of Al in (Nb) than in binary Nb-Al alloys, at 1300 °C shows the presence of a mixed oxide layer of NbAlO4 and HfO2 exhibiting parabolic growth. {\textcopyright} 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Local chemical fluctuations (LCFs) in HEAs were found to have significant influences on their mechanical performance, however, the underlying origins remain unclear. In this work, direct dynamic observation of the interaction between LCFs and dislocations was captured by in situ transmission electron microscopy in a ductile body-centered-cubic (BCC) HfNbTiZr HEA under loading. The observed dislocation pinning induced by LCFs contributes to the increment not only in the strength but also in the ductility due to strongly promoted dislocation interaction. The observed local double cross-slips caused by the LCFs distribute dislocations onto various atomic planes homogenously, which is also beneficial for ductilization in HfNbTiZr. Our findings not only shed light on the understanding of deformation mechanisms of HEAs, but also provide a new perspective to design ductile BCC HEAs.},

Most influential factors on DBT temperature (DBTT) is chemical compositions, ferrite volume fraction and purity of cast steel. Compared with forged steels with similar fracture unit, the present cast steels show much lower DBTT, which is attributed to dispersed austenite grains that hinder the cleavage crack initiation and propagation.

Increasing both strength and ductility further is challenging. In the present study, we demonstrate via meticulous experiments that the CoCrFeNi HEA with the addition of the substitutional metalloid Si can retain a single-phase FCC structure while its yield strength (up to 65{\%}), ultimate strength (up to 34{\%}), and ductility (up to 15{\%}) are simultaneously increased, owing to a synthetical effect of the enhanced solid solution strengthening and a reduced SFE. The dislocation behaviors and plastic deformation mechanisms were tuned by the addition of Si, which improves the strain hardening and tensile ductility. The present study provides new strategies for enhancing HEA performance by targeted metalloid additions.},

abstract = {The stacking fault energy is closely related to structural phase transformations and can help to understand plastic deformation mechanisms in materials. Here we perform first principles calculations of the stacking fault energy in the face centered cubic (fcc) Cobalt-based binary alloys Co1−x Mx, where M = Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd and W. We investigate the concentration range between 0 and 30 at.{\%} of the alloying element. The results are discussed in connection to the phase transition between the low-temperature hexagonal close packed (hcp) and the fcc structures observed in Co and its alloys. By analyzing the stacking fault energies, we show that alloying Co with Cr, Ru, and Rh promotes the hcp phase formation while Fe, Ni and Pd favor the fcc phase instead. The effect of Mo and W on the phase transition differs from the other elements, that is, for concentrations below 10{\%} the intrinsic stacking fault energy is lower than that for pure fcc Co and the energy barrier is higher, whereas above 10{\%} the situation reverses. We carry out also thermodynamic calculations using the ThermoCalc software. The trends of the ab initio stacking fault energy are found to agree well with those of the molar Gibbs energy differences and the phase transition temperature in the binary phase diagrams and give a solid support for the phase stability of these alloys.},

abstract = {Refractory multi-element alloys (RMEA) with body-centered cubic (bcc) structure have been the object of much research over the last decade due to their high potential as candidate materials for high-temperature applications. Most of these alloys display a remarkable strength at high temperatures, which cannot be explained by the standard model of bcc plasticity based on thermally-activated screw dislocation motion. Several works have pointed to chemical energy fluctuations as an essential aspect of RMEA strength that is not captured by standard models. In this work, we quantify the contribution of screw dislocations to the strength of equiatomic Nb-Ta-V alloys using a kinetic Monte Carlo model fitted to solution energetics obtained from atomistic calculations. In agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, we find that chemical energy fluctuations along the dislocation line lead to measurable concentrations of kinks in equilibrium in a wide temperature range. A fraction of these form cross-kink configurations, which are ultimately found to control screw dislocation motion and material strength. Our simulations (i) confirm that the evolution of cross kinks and self-pinning are strong contributors to the so-called ‘cocktail' effect in this alloy at low temperature, and (ii) substantiate the notion that screw dislocation plasticity alone cannot explain the high temperature strength of bcc RMEA.},

Here, we report the tensile creep behavior at 980°C and 1,100°C of TiZrHfNbTa, a body-centered cubic (BCC), solid solution RHEA, and compare it with single crystals of a leading precipitate-strengthened Ni-base superalloy, CMSX-4, as well as its solid solution matrix. The superalloy is 25 times stronger in creep than the RHEA at 980°C and 70 times stronger at 1,100°C. Even the single-phase matrix of CMSX-4 has three times the creep strength of the RHEA at 980°C. We also find that the microstructure of the RHEA is unstable and undergoes phase decomposition during creep. In light of these observations, we discuss the temperature ranges where RHEAs may or may not be competitive with Ni-base superalloys.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys are random alloys with five or more components, often near equi-composition, that often exhibit excellent mechanical properties. Guiding the design of new materials across the wide composition space requires an ability to compute necessary underlying material parameters via ab initio methods. Here, density functional theory is used to compute the elemental misfit volumes, alloy lattice constant, elastic constants, and stable stacking fault energy in the fcc noble metal RhIrPdPtNiCu. These properties are then used in a recent theory for the temperature and strain-rate dependent yield strength. The parameter-free prediction of 583 MPa is in excellent agreement with the measured value of 527 MPa. This quantitative connection between alloy composition and yield strength, without any experimental input, motivates this general density functional theory-based methodological path for exploring new potential high-strength high-entropy alloys, in this and other alloy classes, with the chemical accuracy of first-principles methods.},

abstract = {In traditional body-centered cubic (bcc) metals, the core properties of screw dislocations play a critical role in plastic deformation at low temperatures. Recently, much attention has been focused on refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs), which also possess bcc crystal structures. However, unlike face-centered cubic high-entropy alloys (HEAs), there have been far fewer investigations into bcc HEAs, specifically on the possible effects of chemical short-range order (SRO) in these multiple principal element alloys on dislocation mobility. Here, using density functional theory, we investigate the distribution of dislocation core properties in MoNbTaW RHEAs alloys, and how they are influenced by SRO. The average values of the core energies in the RHEA are found to be larger than those in the corresponding pure constituent bcc metals, and are relatively insensitive to the degree of SRO. However, the presence of SRO is shown to have a large effect on narrowing the distribution of dislocation core energies and decreasing the spatial heterogeneity of dislocation core energies in the RHEA. It is argued that the consequences of the mechanical behavior of HEAs is a change in the energy landscape of the dislocations, which would likely heterogeneously inhibit their motion.},

abstract = {The hydrogen embrittlement (HE) may sometimes affect the Martensitic Steels following surface treatments. This damage appears to be dependent on baking time during which hydrogen can be desorbed from the sample and/or be redistributed within the material. The present study aims to identify the evolution of different hydrogen states in a quenched and tempered martensitic steel during the desorption phase and to evaluate their effects on the mechanical behavior in a simple tensile test on smooth specimens. The present work shows that during baking phase at specific temperatures, a real competition exists between desorption and deep trapping on specific defects (vacancies and/or dislocations) of diffusible hydrogen. The transition between both the regimes implies a times range for which the initially ductile rupture becomes a quasi-cleavage process. This transition of the fracture mechanisms is directly correlated to a time at which the flux of hydrogen is maximized. The critical stress for quasi-cleavage fracture was assessed at 435. MPa and ductile fracture criterion follows a Beremin form, which suggests a predominance of decohesion at inclusion and/or precipitate interfaces less affected by hydrogen (critical stress around 600.

The impact toughness values of the as-cast high-entropy alloy were much higher than those of many traditional alloys, particularly at low temperatures. The mechanical properties of the as-cast high-entropy alloy were compared with those of wrought high-entropy alloy and noticeable differences between the two alloys were found. The maximum tensile ductility and three different strain hardening stages were observed at 500 °C in the as-cast structure. Transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrated that the initiation of deformation twinning was very active even at 500 °C. A simple calculation suggests that very large grains of the as-cast structure induced a reduction in twinning stress, retarding the onset of strain localization.},

In the AIM approach, the problem is mapped to a 1D spin-model and the interaction parameters are obtained using energies for ordered structures, thus obviating the need to handle faulted structure. For elemental Ni, the calculated values of ISF from AIM and supercell approaches differ by not more than by 2, and compares well with experimental value.

Our aim in this overview paper is, after a description of the methodology regarding in particular the boundary conditions, to review the new and unexpected results obtained on dislocation cores from first principles, including the identification of unforeseen stable and metastable cores and the quantitative evaluation of both interaction energies and energy pathways, in pure metals and alloys of different crystallography (FCC, BCC, HCP) as well as semiconductors.

abstract = {Bulk metallic materials have ordinarily been produced by melting and solidification processes for the last several thousand years. However, metallic liquid is unstable at temperatures below the melting temperature and solidifies immediately into crystalline phases. Consequently, all bulk engineering alloys are composed of a crystalline structure. Recently, this common concept was exploded by the findings of the stabilization phenomenon of the supercooled liquid for a number of alloys in the Mg-, lanthanide-, Zr-, Ti-, Fe-, Co-, Pd-Cu- and Ni-based systems. The alloys with the stabilized supercooled liquid state have three features in their alloy components, i.e. multicomponent systems, significant atomic size ratios above 12{\%}, and negative heats of mixing. The stabilization mechanism has also been investigated from experimental data of structure analyses and fundamental physical properties. The stabilization has enabled the production of bulk amorphous alloys in the thickness range of 1-100 mm by using various casting processes. Bulk amorphous Zr-based alloys exhibit high mechanical strength, high fracture toughness and good corrosion resistance and have been used for sporting goods materials. The stabilization also leads to the appearance of a large supercooled liquid region before crystallization and enables high-strain rate super-plasticity through Newtonian flow. The new Fe- and Co-based amorphous alloys exhibit a large super-cooled liquid region and good soft magnetic properties which are characterized by low coercive force and high permeability. Furthermore, homogeneous dispersion of nanoscale particles into Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys was found to cause an improvement of tensile strength without detriment to good ductility. The discovery of the stabilization phenomenon, followed by the clarification of the stabilization criteria of the supercooled liquid, will promise the future definite development of bulk amorphous alloys as new basic science and engineering materials.},

Similarities with bulk metallic phenomena suggest that hydrogen embrittlement from ambient humidity, resulting from the reaction Alalloy +3(H2O)air= Al(OH)3- +3H+ may be the operative mechanism. This proposal was tested on pre-oxidized Ren{\'{e}} N5 by standard cathodic hydrogen charging in 1N H2SO4, as monitored by weight change, induced current, and microstructure. Cathodic polarization at -2.0 V abruptly stripped mature Al2O3 scales at the oxide-metal interface. Anodic polarization at +2.0 V, however, produced alloy dissolution. Finally, with no applied voltage, the acid electrolyte produced neither scale spallation nor alloy dissolution. Thus, hydrogen charging was detrimental to alumina scale adhesion. Moisture-induced interfacial hydrogen embrittlement is concluded to be the cause of delayed scale spallation and desktop thermal barrier coating failures.},

However, most existing RHEAs lack room-temperature ductility, similar to conventional refractory metals and alloys. Here, we propose an alloy design strategy to intrinsically ductilize RHEAs based on the electron theory and more specifically to decrease the number of valence electrons through controlled alloying. A new ductile RHEA, Hf0.5Nb0.5Ta0.5Ti1.5Zr, was developed as a proof of concept, with a fracture stress of close to 1 GPa and an elongation of near 20{\%}. The findings here will shed light on the development of ductile RHEAs for ultrahigh-temperature applications in aerospace and power-generation industries.},

abstract = {We have evaluated the tensile behavior of commercially pure tungsten (W) as a function of low-temperature rolling. It is observed that rolling below the nominal recrystallization temperature 1523 K (1250 °C) concomitantly enhances the ductility and strength of W. Strain-rate jump tests and stress-relaxation experiments show that low-temperature rolling also renders reduced strain-rate sensitivity and activation volumes associated with the plastic deformation of W. For W samples rolled at 873 K (600 °C), with a total equivalent strain of ∼2.5 (including a previous rolling strain of 1.7 introduced at 1073 K [800 °C]), the activation volume for plastic deformation is around 10b3 (b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector of W). This is in agreement with a double-kink mechanism with the spreading between the kinks controlled by the forest dislocation density. Fractographic observations indicate that the rolled W exhibits a laminar structure. The layer thickness is a function of rolling temperature, rather than a function of rolling strain introduced. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A comparison between the dipole and cluster approaches for the study of the core structure and Peierls potential of 1/2 〈111〉 screw dislocations in bcc metals is presented. It is based on first principles electronic structure calculations in alpha iron carried out within the DFT framework using localized basis functions as implemented in the SIESTA code. The effect of the energetic model is first investigated on the {\{}211{\}} and {\{}110{\}} generalized stacking fault energy ($\gamma$) surfaces which are known to be closely related to the dislocation core properties. All DFT results yield similar shapes-characteristic of a non-degenerate core structure-and the effect of the exchange-correlation functional is shown to be larger than the discrepancies between SIESTA and planewave-pseudopotential results. The core structure is found to be non-degenerate, with an excellent agreement between the various approaches on the deviation from the linear elasticity theory of the atomic positions. In the dipole approach, the interaction between dislocations is dominated by elastic effects, but significant anisotropic core-core interactions are evidenced, which strongly affect the energetics of the system when a triangular array of dipoles is used. For the calculation of the Peierls potential a very good agreement is obtained between the cluster approach and the dipole approach, provided that a quadrupolar-like arrangement is used. Similar calculations are performed with the EAM potential proposed by Mendelev et al. [Philos. Mag. 83, 3977 (2003)] for iron; the comparison between the two sets of results is briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to answer the question of whether an ultra fine grained (UFG) microstructure has an impact on the nature of the brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) of tungsten. Therefore, four-point bend tests were performed using unnotched 100 $\mu$m UFG tungsten foil and annealed coarse-grained polycrystalline tungsten foil (2073 K for 2 h in vacuum) with exactly the same chemical composition and dimensions. The reported results for coarse-grained tungsten foil show a strain-rate dependent BDT that occurs between 350 and 450 K. The activation energy of the BDT, EBDT, for the coarse-grained material was deduced to be 2.9 (+ 2.6/- 0.9) eV. The results obtained from UFG tungsten foil indicate a strain-rate independent BDT at relatively low temperatures (≈ 77 K). The strong disparity in the nature of the BDT can be attributed solely to the presence of microstructural differences. The possible mechanism controlling the BDT in tungsten for both tungsten foil conditions will be discussed against this background and in the light of previous studies performed on the nature of the BDT of tungsten reported in pertinent literature.},

However, these compounds tend to derive their fascinating properties from a myriad of interactions spanning multiple scales, from localized chemical bonding to macroscopic interactions between grains. This diversity has limited the ability of researchers to develop new materials on a reasonable timeline. Fortunately, the advent of machine learning in materials science has provided a new approach to analyze high-dimensional space and identify correlations among the structure-composition-property-processing relationships that may have been previously missed. In this review, we examine some successful examples of using data science to improve known structural materials by analyzing fatigue and failure, and we discuss approaches to develop entirely new classes of structural materials in complex composition spaces including high-entropy alloys and bulk metallic glasses. Highlighting the recent advancement in this field demonstrates the power of data-driven methodologies that will hopefully lead to the production of market-ready structural materials.},

abstract = {The structural stability of topologically close-packed phases in binary transition metal alloys is investigated with a combination of first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory and the Bragg-Williams-Gorsky approximation for the description of the configurational entropy. For a variety of different (i) exchange-correlation functionals, (ii) pseudopotentials, and (iii) relaxation schemes, for the relevant phases in Re-X (X = Ta, V, W) binary systems, we compare the energy of formation at T = 0 K, as well as the phase diagrams and site occupancies at finite temperatures. We confirm previous findings that the configurational entropy plays a stabilising role for complex phases in these systems at elevated temperatures. Small differences in the calculated energy of formation for different exchange-correlation functionals, pseudopotentials and relaxation schemes are expected, but give rise to qualitatively different phase diagrams. We employ these differences in order to estimate the order of magnitude of the standard deviation necessary in the qualitatively-reliable calculation of phase diagrams and site occupancies. In an attempt to determine the accuracy that is required to assure a qualitatively correct prediction of phase diagrams, we modify our first-principles results numerically by random variations with the determined standard deviation as maximum amplitude. Taking the order of site occupancies and the set of stable phases as simple criteria for a qualitatively correct prediction, we find that the accuracy required for the energy of formation of the individual configurations in these systems is approximately 5 meV/atom (≈0.5 kJ/mol at). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The key component of the theory is the force between atoms, and we discuss how this can be computed from empirical or quantum mechanical models. The basic model is developed to link the amplitudes of vibrations to thermodynamics. The major method for measuring lattice dynamics is inelastic scattering of beams of neutrons and x-rays. We develop a simplified theory of inelastic scattering of radiation beams, and show how this can be used in instrumentation. Several examples are used to illustrate the theory.},

abstract = {A new, fourth generation, single crystal superalloy has been jointly developed by GE Aircraft Engines, Pratt {\&} Whitney and NASA. The focus of the effort was to develop a turbine airfoil alloy with long-term durability for use in the High Speed Civil Transport. In order to achieve adequate long-time strength improvements at moderate temperatures and retain good microstructural stability, it was necessary to make significant composition changes from 2 nd and 3rd generation single crystal superalloys. These included lower chromium levels, higher cobalt and rhenium levels and the inclusion of a new alloying element, ruthenium. It was found that higher Co levels were beneficial to reducing both TCP precipitation and SRZ formation. Ruthenium caused the refractory elements to partition more strongly to the $\gamma$′ phase, which resulted in better overall alloy stability. The final alloy, EPM-102, had significant creep rupture and fatigue improvements over the baseline production alloys and had acceptable microstructural stability. The alloy is currently being engine tested and evaluated for advanced engine applications.},

Here we elucidate the complex interplay between segregation, short-range order, and strengthening in the NbMoTaW MPEA through atomistic simulations with a highly accurate machine learning interatomic potential. In the single crystal MPEA, we find greatly reduced anisotropy in the critically resolved shear stress between screw and edge dislocations compared to the elemental metals. In the polycrystalline MPEA, we demonstrate that thermodynamically driven Nb segregation to the grain boundaries (GBs) and W enrichment within the grains intensifies the observed short-range order (SRO). The increased GB stability due to Nb enrichment reduces the von Mises strain, resulting in higher strength than a random solid solution MPEA. These results highlight the need to simultaneously tune GB composition and bulk SRO to tailor the mechanical properties of MPEAs.},

abstract = {A computational method for partitioning a charge density grid into Bader volumes is presented which is efficient, robust, and scales linearly with the number of grid points. The partitioning algorithm follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The second-generation single-crystal superalloy DD6 with [001] orientation was prepared by screw selecting method in the directionally solidified furnace. The long-term aging of the alloy after full heat treatment was performed at 1100 °C for 400 h. Then the rejuvenation heat treatment 1300 °C/4 h/AC ? 1120 °C/4 h/AC ? 870 °C/24 h/AC was carried out. The stress rupture properties were investigated at 760 °C/800 MPa, 850 °C/550 MPa, 980 °C/250 MPa and 1100 °C/140 MPa after different heat treatments. The microstructures of the alloy at different conditions were studied by SEM. The results show that c0 phase of the alloy became very irregular and larger after long-term aging at 1100 °Cfor 400 h.A very small amount of needle-shaped TCP phase precipitated in the dendrite core. The coarsened $\gamma$ phase and TCP phase dissolved entirely after rejuvenation heat treatment. The microstructure was restored and almost same with the original microstructure. The stress rupture life of the alloy decreased in different degrees at various test conditions after long-term aging. The stress rupture life of the alloy after rejuvenation heat treatment all restores to the original specimen more than 80{\%} at different conditions. The microstructure degradation of the alloy during long-term aging includes coarsening of the c0 phase, P-type raft and precipitation of TCP phase, which results in the degeneration of stress rupture property. The rejuvenation heat treatment succeeds in restoring the original microstructure and stress rupture properties of the alloy.},

The fracture surface of the specimen after the miniaturized Charpy impact test at 98 K (−175 °C) mainly consisted of cleavage fracture facets parallel to crystallographic {\{}001{\}} planes of martensite. Through the crystallographic orientation analysis of micro-crack propagation, we found that the boundaries which separated different martensite variants having large misorientation angles of {\{}001{\}} cleavage planes could inhibit crack propagation.

The atomistic simulations examine the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curves for the {\{}0 1 1{\}}, {\{}2̄11{\}} and {\{}0 0 1{\}} planes. The slip directions considered are 〈1 0 0〉, 〈1 1 1〉 and 〈0 1 1〉. The results show the smallest energy barriers for the (0 1 1)[1 0 0] case, which is consistent with the experimental observations of dislocation slip reported in this study. To our knowledge, slip on the (0 1 1)[11̄1] system is illustrated for the first time in our TEM findings, and atomistic simulations confirm that this system has the second lowest energy barrier. Specimens that underwent thermal cycling and pseudoelasticity show dislocation slip primarily in the austenite domains while the bulk of martensite domains does not display dislocations. The results are discussed via calculation of the ideal slip nucleation stress levels for the five potential slip systems in austenite. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {Most of the opinion dynamics models in sociophysics have their historic origin in studies two-dimensional magnetization phenomena. This metaphor has proven quite useful, as it allowed to use well known techniques, relating individual behaviours of single spins and their interactions, to large scale properties, such as magnetization or magnetic domains creation. These physical properties were then ``mapped'' to social concepts: spin orientation to a person's views on a specific issue, magnetization to global opinion on the issue, etc. During the past 20 years, the models were significantly expanded, using more complex individual agent characteristics and even more complex types of the interactions, but the power of the metaphor remained unchanged. In the current paper we propose to use a new physical system as the basis for new ideas in sociophysics. We shall argue that the concepts and tools devoted to studies of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) could significantly broaden the range of social concepts ``addressable'' by sociophysics, by focusing on a wider range of global phenomena, arising from atomic properties, interactions and arrangements. We illustrate the new idea by calculating a few characteristics of a simple HEA system and their possible ``mapping'' into social concepts.},

It was shown that the (CoCrFeMn)40Ni60 MEA exhibits as high tensile properties as the CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy. Not only the mechanical strength but also the ductility are the same in both alloys. Moreover, the uncertainty when comparing nanoindentation on homogenized samples with tensile yield strength was quantified. Knowing that, nanoindentation on homogenized HEA was identified as a powerful tool for fast exploring of chemical compositions and pre-selection of the most promising ones.},

The capability to predict phase stability from fundamental properties of constituent elements would benefit the alloy design greatly. The relationship between phase stability and properties of alloying components in HEAs was studied systematically. The mixing enthalpy is found to be the key factor controlling the formation of solid solutions or compounds. The stability of fcc and bcc solid solutions is well delineated by the valance electron concentration (VEC). The revealing of the effect of the VEC on the phase stability is vitally important for alloy design and for controlling the mechanical behavior of HEAs.},

abstract = {We investigate the behaviors of rhenium (Re) and osmium (Os) and their interactions with point defects in tungsten (W) using a first-principles method. We show that Re atoms are energetically favorable to disperse separately in bulk W due to the Re-Re repulsive interaction. Despite the attractive interaction between Os atoms, there is still a large activation energy barrier of 1.10 eV at the critical number of 10 for the formation of Os clusters in bulk W based on the results of the total nucleation free energy change. Interestingly, the presence of vacancy can significantly reduce the total nucleation free energy change of Re/Os clusters, suggesting that vacancy can facilitate the nucleation of Re/Os in W. Re/Os in turn has an effect on the stability of the vacancy clusters (Vn) in W, especially for small vacancy clusters. A single Re/Os atom can raise the total binding energies of V2 and V3 obviously, thus enhancing their formation. Further, we demonstrate that there is a strong attractive interaction between Re/Os and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs). Re/Os could increase the diffusion barrier of SIAs and decrease their rotation barrier, while the interstitial-mediated path may be the optimal diffusion path of Re/Os in W. Consequently, the synergistic effect between Re/Os and point defects plays a key role in Re/Os precipitation and the evolution of defects in irradiated W.},

abstract = {Traditional metallic alloys are mixtures of elements in which the atoms of minority species tend to be distributed randomly if they are below their solubility limit, or to form secondary phases if they are above it. The concept of multiple-principal-element alloys has recently expanded this view, as these materials are single-phase solid solutions of generally equiatomic mixtures of metallic elements. This group of materials has received much interest owing to their enhanced mechanical properties1–5. They are usually called medium-entropy alloys in ternary systems and high-entropy alloys in quaternary or quinary systems, alluding to their high degree of configurational entropy. However, the question has remained as to how random these solid solutions actually are, with the influence of short-range order being suggested in computational simulations but not seen experimentally6,7. Here we report the observation, using energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy, of structural features attributable to short-range order in the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy. Increasing amounts of such order give rise to both higher stacking-fault energy and hardness. These findings suggest that the degree of local ordering at the nanometre scale can be tailored through thermomechanical processing, providing a new avenue for tuning the mechanical properties of medium- and high-entropy alloys.},

abstract = {The chemical bond as a physical linkage between atoms has proven to be an immensely powerful heuristic device, providing insight into the general relationships between the structure and properties of molecules and solids. Unfortunately, the bond concept is incomplete and fails to explain more subtle aspects of molecular and materials behavior. A rich set of examples is provided by attempts to identify the structural origins of nonzero Cauchy pressures, a quantity that has been said to reflect the nature of the bonding at the atomic level. We show that these deviations are easily explained by extending the concept of a bond from a linkage between atoms to a set of linkages between charge density critical points (maxima, minima, and saddle points). Further, we show that these links possess an identifiable structure with measurable characteristics. For the nonmagnetic bcc transition metals, we are able to write the Cauchy pressure as a function of these characteristic measures. Significantly, the model should be generalizable to other structures and will provide insight into the relationships between the charge density and elastic response.},

abstract = {By changing the temperature of deformation, during tensile experiments on single crystals of aluminium, it has proved possible to separate reversible changes of flow stress with temperature from irreversible ones. Below 130 degrees K the reversible change of flow stress is large; above room temperature it is hardly more than the change of elastic constants with temperature. These reversible changes are highly reproducible and, over a wide range of cold-worked states, proportional to the flow stress itself. The principal irreversible effect is a sharp yield drop, accompanied by a Luders band, which appears when a crystal is strained plastically at a high temperature (e.g. 300 degrees K) immediately after being heavily cold-worked at a low temperature (e.g. 90 degrees K). Intermediate annealing treatments reduce or eliminate this yield drop. Other experiments have proved that the yield drop is not a strain-ageing phenomenon but an extreme example of work softening, and that work hardening induced by preliminary deformation at the low temperature becomes unstable during plastic deformation at the high temperature and is rapidly removed. An explanation of the yield drop is suggested, based on recent theories of work hardening. It is proposed that, under the combined influence of stress and temperature, sessile dislocations at the heads of piled-up groups of dislocations become unlocked; the piled-up groups then partly collapse and many dislocations are released for slip. The reversible changes of flow stress are interpreted in terms of the intersection of dislocation lines.},

abstract = {The topic of deformation in metals has been long studied and a large store of knowledge has been cataloged. The theoretical strengths of metals have always exceeded the actual measured strengths, a phenomena explained by the presence of dislocations. Plastic deformation is always associated with dislocation motion along crystallographic slip planes. This dissertation seeks to address a class of deformation mechanisms that involves the coordinated shear of multiple parallel slip planes, which can lead to the formation of complex stacking faults, deformation twins, and dislocations on the slip planes has been observed in BCC and HCP metals. It is also well known that the formation of stacking faults and twin bands require a condition of either low temperature or high strain rate, thus linking these deformation mechanisms to the phenomenon of ductile-to-brittle transition.    The first part of this dissertation postulates expressions to describe the multi-plane slip behavior in BCC metals, which are then incorporated into a continuum-based model. Although a full twin band involves the coordinated shear of several atomic planes, experimental observation and atomistic simulations have suggested that as few as two or three slipping planes, that is, an incipient complex stacking fault, may be emitted by a sharp crack and act as the precursor for larger scale twin-band formation. Thus, the scope of the model is limited to include three slip planes ahead of, and parallel to, a crack tip.    This so-called multi-plane model is constructed using concepts developed in the Peierls-Nabarro model and a continuum-based method of superposing an array of infinitesimal dislocations to simulate arbitrary slip distributions between two elastic continua.    The model is demonstrated to be versatile and exhibits the multiple-plane slip modes previously mentioned, in addition to reverting to single-plane dislocation formation when an appropriate interplanar constitutive relation is assumed. The model is developed to be empirical, and is not material specific. To tailor the model to particular material systems, the analysis includes obtaining multi-plane slip data from an existing atomistic simulation of $\alpha$-Fe using a Finnis-Sinclair embedded atom potential, as well as data from the Morse potential. This model is adaptable and can provide insight on intrinsic material properties and behaviors under specific conditions leading to brittle failure.},

abstract = {Using ab initio calculations and symmetrized plane waves, we analyze the basal-plane generalized stacking fault energies in pure Mg and Mg-Y alloys and show that the knowledge of energies of only five specific points is sufficient to accurately predict the core structures and Peierls stresses of (a)-type edge dislocations in these alloys. Our five-point approach substantially reduces the computational cost related to the Peierls-Nabarro (PN) model and allows for a high-throughput application of the PN model to study Peierls stress changes in Mg upon alloying. We employ our approach to study Mg binary alloys containing nine rare-earth (RE) and 11 other solutes. Based on the Peierls stresses of these 20 Mg alloys calculated from the Peierls-Nabarro model, the solutes are divided into three groups: (i) the first group, consisting of Be, Zn, Tl, Tc, Os, Ru, Re, and Co, when added as solutes into Mg, lead to more compact dislocation core structures and larger Peierls stresses than found for pure Mg. (ii) Elements in the second group, including Ti, Nd, Lu, Zr, Hf, La, and Pr change the core widths and Peierls stresses moderately. (iii) The solutes in the third group containing Y, Er, Tm, Ho, and Sc extend the stacking fault width, and the resulting Peierls stresses are generally very low. Based on an error analysis, we conclude that the first group has a clear solute strengthening effect and the third group has a clear solute softening effect, while the effects of the elements in the second group are too small to be resolved by the present approach.},

Yet, the yield strength values of medium- and high-entropy alloys investigated so far do not substantially exceed those of conventional alloys owing to the insufficient utilization of lattice distortion. Here it is shown that a simple VCoNi equiatomic medium-entropy alloy exhibits a near 1 GPa yield strength and good ductility, outperforming conventional solid-solution alloys. It is demonstrated that a wide fluctuation of the atomic bond distances in such alloys, i.e., severe lattice distortion, improves both yield stress and its sensitivity to grain size. In addition, the dislocation-mediated plasticity effectively enhances the strength–ductility relationship by generating nanosized dislocation substructures due to massive pinning. The results demonstrate that severe lattice distortion is a key property for identifying extra-strong materials for structural engineering applications.},

Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying the mobilities of screw and edge dislocations in the body-centered cubic MoNbTaW RHEA over a wide temperature range using extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on a highly-accurate machine-learning interatomic potential. Further, we specifically evaluate how these mechanisms are affected by the presence of SRO. The mobility of edge dislocations is found to be enhanced by the presence of SRO, whereas the rate of double-kink nucleation in the motion of screw dislocations is reduced, although this influence of SRO appears to be attenuated at increasing temperature. Independent of the presence of SRO, a cross-slip locking mechanism is observed for the motion of screws, which provides for extra strengthening for refractory high-entropy alloy system.},

The change in internal state manifests itself in many ways, but the two ways that concern us in this review are (i) the creation of internal stress arising from the strain incompatibility between grains and/or the formation of cell/sub-grain structures and (ii) a change in the material resistance. This review aims to provide a clear separation of these two concepts by exploring the origin of each term and how it is associated with the creep deformation mechanism. Experimental techniques used to measure the internal stress and internal resistance over different length-scales are critically reviewed. It is demonstrated that the interpretation of the measured values requires knowledge of the dominant creep deformation mechanism. Finally, the concluding comments provide a summary of the key messages delivered in this review and highlight the challenges that remain to be addressed.},

To obtain such specific characteristics, the raw materials must be melted in inert protective atmosphere, and then heat treated for the homogenization of the microstructure and chemical composition. In the paper, there have been studied three types of high entropy alloys, HfMoNiTaW, 2HfMoNi2Ta and MoNiTaW obtained in the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) equipment.

In order to follow the defor- mation processes in the material, several samples were strained to defined straining states, up to a maximum engineering strain of 10{\%}, and prepared for post-mortem analysis. The nanocrystalline structure was investigated by quantitative automated crystal orientation mapping (ACOM) in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), identifying grain growth and twinning/detwinning resulting from dislocation activity as two of the mechanisms contributing to the macroscopic deformation. Depending on the initial twin density, the samples behaved differently. For low initial twin densities, an increasing twin density was found during straining. On the other hand, starting from a higher twin density, the twins were depleted with increasing strain. The findings from ACOM- TEM were confirmed by results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and from conventional and in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (CXRD, SXRD) experiments. 554},

The vast compositional parameter space makes these alloys a unique area of exploration by means of computational design. However, as of now a method to compute efficiently, yet with high accuracy the thermodynamic properties of such alloys has been missing. One of the underlying reasons is the lack of accurate and efficient approaches to compute vibrational free energies—including anharmonicity—for these chemically complex multicomponent alloys. In this work, a density-functional-theory based approach to overcome this issue is developed based on a combination of thermodynamic integration and a machine-learning potential. We demonstrate the performance of the approach by computing the anharmonic free energy of the prototypical five-component VNbMoTaW refractory high entropy alloy.},

abstract = {The energy associated with shearing of planes of atoms in a crystal is the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE). It is a crucial material property for describing nanoscale plasticity phenomena in crystalline materials, such as dislocation dissociation, nucleation, and twinning. The dependence of the GSFE on applied stress normal to the stacking fault has been suggested to influence such phenomena. Here, the stacking fault stress dependence is analyzed through (i) the generalized stacking fault potential energy (GSFE) and (ii) the generalized stacking fault enthalpy (GSFH). At an imposed shear displacement, there is also an associated inelastic inter-planar normal displacement around the fault. Extensive molecular statics simulations with interatomic potentials and/or first principle calculations in Ni, Cu, Al and Mg reveal that GSFE and inelastic normal displacement both increase with tensile stress. An increasing GSFE contradicts long-standing wisdom and previous studies. Positive inelastic normal displacement coupled to the applied normal stress decreases the GSFH, but is not useful for general mechanics problems. The existence of the inelastic displacement can lead to incorrect measurements of the GSFE and GSFH in finite systems loaded by an applied strain. Application of the GSFE and the inelastic normal displacement to both fcc dissociation distance versus applied normal stress and crack tip dislocation emission under mixed Mode II/I loading show very good agreement with direct simulations. In general, “opening softening” effects are not universal, and so the analysis of any particular nanomechanics problem requires precise implementation of the combination of GSFE and inelastic normal displacement rather than the GSFH.},

The evolution of engine architectures changes the relative value of specific technologies. The engines of the future will be advanced gas turbines due to their superior fuel burn at the aircraft level. They will be fueled by sustainable liquid hydrocarbons. Both the thermal and propulsive efficiency of the gas turbine can be significantly improved. The need to improve propulsive efficiency has driven engine bypass ratio up, to 12 recently, and higher in the future. This is a different, less familiar design space than the 5 to 8 bypass ratio, which characterized the last 40 years of engine experience. Realignment of research priorities is required to address 21st century challenges, such as the knowledge needed to realize efficient engines at very small core sizes. The new challenges open up new opportunities for both designers and researchers.},

abstract = {Long periodic stacking ordered phases (LPSOs), consisting of various configurations of stacking faults, play an important role in developing ultrastrong Mg alloys with moderate ductility. However, their formation mechanisms are far from clear as no apparent defects are introduced during their formation as it is commonly believed that stacking faults are induced by defects. Here, we present the atomic and electronic basis for lattice-distortion-mediated formation of stacking faults, i.e., localized face-centred-cubic (FCC) structures, within a Mg-Zn-Y alloy with a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure. The atomic motion trajectories from ab-initio molecular dynamic simulations show that the Mg atoms occupying the nearest neighbour positions of Zn and Y solute atoms undergo a local HCP-to-FCC transition. It is revealed that a local lattice distortion caused by the solute atoms enables the Mg atoms to move and rearrange into a local FCC configuration, which is validated by high resolution scanning transmission microscopy and in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Our simulations provide profound insight into the formation mechanism of stacking faults in HCP Mg and their physical nature of phase transformations. This is not only critically important because conventional defects, such as dislocations and vacancies, are important to deformation for Mg and its alloys, but also because they serve as a potential new approach to the design of advanced Mg alloys when defects could be used to facilitate.},

abstract = {An analytic model describing substitutional solid solution strengthening in body-centered cubic (BCC) complex, concentrated alloys (CCAs) based on a/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocation mobility is developed and presented. At lower temperatures it is assumed that dipole dragging is the rate limiting strengthening mechanism, and as the temperature increases this changes to a jog dragging mechanism. While both mechanisms are contained in Suzuki's classical model for substitutional solid solution strengthening developed for BCC alloys significant modifications are required to apply such a model to the refractory CCA's. First, two approaches for incorporating the net effects of the complex solute chemistry are developed and contrasted using a ternary NbTaTi alloy and four quaternary alloys, MoNbTaTi, WNbTaTi, CrMoNbTi and CrMoTaTi. Our model is extended to higher temperatures and applied to analyze experimental yield data as a function of temperature (0.15–0.7TL, where TL is the absolute liquidus temperature) and strain rate (10−5 to 10−2/s) in a range of BCC chemically complex alloys including stoichiometric NbTiZr and HfNbTaTiZr. We find that the model, based on just these two mechanisms, gives excellent agreement with experimental yield data in both these BCC CCAs, NbTiZr and HfNbTaTiZr. The experimental yield data of these two BCC CCA's as well as NbTaTi and four quaternaries are also analyzed using Maresca's edge dislocation model developed for these types of alloys. The screw model presented is useful in predicting BCC CCAs with adequate high temperature strength, which will accelerate development of high temperature, high strength BCC alloys for aerospace applications.},

@article{Divinski2018,
abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) are considered as a novel class of materials with a large number of components available in nearly equatomic proportions. One of the characteristic properties of HEAs was believed to be so-called "sluggish" diffusion. The faith on this myth instead of rigorous experimental analysis played such a dominant role that the first set of data on interdiffusion, in fact based on an improper analysis, were cited in hundreds of articles to state the presence of sluggishness of diffusion rates in high entropy alloys. In this review, the recent data on atomic diffusion in HEAs are critically discussed. The discussion is focused on tracer diffusion which is already measured dominantly for polycrystalline, but in some cases for single crystalline high-entropy alloys. Alternatively, a rigorous analysis of the interdiffuson experiments, which provide the diffusion rates of chemical species, too, becomes more and more sophisticated for three and more elements in an alloy and it is challenging to derive physically sound quantities from a general multicomponent diffusion experiment. Most promising in this case is the diffusion couple technique, especially the so-called pseudo-binary approach. This approach is analyzed with a focus on the applicability and the possible errors induced if up-hill diffusion appears. It is shown that atomic diffusion in HEAs cannot a priori be considered as sluggish and both atomic interactions as well as correlation effects are responsible for the observed trends. Even if estimated on the same homologous scale, the diffusion retardation induced by a "high entropy" in FCC crystals is not simply proportional to the number of alloying components and it is shown to be similar to that induced by the L12 ordering in a binary system. Furthermore, the importance of cross-correlations in diffusion of different species in HEAs is highlighted.},

However, existing models could hardly reproduce the usually non-linear relationship between the compositions and the lattice constants. Herein, we present a new model within the framework of virtual crystal approximation by taking into account both the size factor and the electronic effect. The model takes inputs as simple as the fundamental property parameters of the elementary substances and N referential SSs for an N-component system, and can then predict the lattice constant of SS with any composition within the system. Systematical validation using datasets obtained from high-throughput first-principles calculations and available experiments confirmed the high reliability and general applicability of our model for various substitutional SSs. Applications and limitations of the model as well as outlooks were also discussed. It is expected that this model will deepen the understanding of the relationship between the composition and the properties of materials.},

abstract = {Dislocation nucleation from a stressed crack tip is analyzed based on the Peierls concept. A periodic relation between shear stress and atomic shear displacement is assumed to hold along the most highly stressed slip plane emanating from a crack tip. This allows some small slip displacement to occur near the tip in response to small applied loading and, with increase in loading, the incipient dislocation configuration becomes unstable and leads to a fully formed dislocation which is driven away from the crack. An exact solution for the loading at that nucleation instability is developed via the J-integral for the case when the crack and slip planes coincide, and an approximate solution is given when they do not. Solutions are also given for emission of dissociated dislocations, especially partial dislocation pairs in fcc crystals. The level of applied stress intensity factors required for dislocation nucleation is shown to be proportional to √$\gamma$us, where $\gamma$us, the unstable stacking energy, is a new solid state parameter identified by the analysis. It is the maximum energy encountered in the block-like sliding along a slip plane, in the Burgers vector direction, of one half of a crystal relative to the other. Approximate estimates of $\gamma$us are summarized and the results are used to evaluate brittle vs ductile response in fcc and bcc metals in terms of the competition between dislocation nucleation and Griffith cleavage at a crack tip. The predictions seem compatible with known behavior and also show that in many cases solids which are predicted to first cleave under pure mode I loading should instead first emit dislocations when that loading includes very small amounts of mode II and III shear. The analysis in this paper also reveals a feature of the near-tip slip distribution corresponding to the saddle point energy configuration for cracks that are loaded below the nucleation threshold, as is of interest for thermal activation. {\textcopyright} 1992 Pergamon Press plc.},

abstract = {In this study, a novel inter-pass cooling technology was applied during rough rolling (R-IPC) to process a 60 mm ultra-heavy EH47 steel plate with excellent toughness and ductility. The plate was compared to a plate processed through conventional thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP). The microstructure evolution at 1/4-thickness and 1/2-thickness of the plates was studied, while the relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties, through tensile and Charpy V-notch impact toughness, was established. In this study, it was reported that the R-IPC steel deformation penetration was higher compared to the TMCP steel. The ferrite fractions of the R-IPC and TMCP steels were 47{\%} and 10{\%} at 1/4-thickness, as well as 35{\%} and 0.5{\%} at 1/2-thickness, while the acicular ferrite fractions at 1/2-thickness of the R-IPC and TMCP steels were 50{\%} and 9.5{\%}, respectively. The granular bainite width at 1/2-thickness of the R-IPC steel (14 ± 4 µm) was significantly lower than the TMCP steel (27 ± 10 µm). The M/A island volume fraction in R-IPC steel was higher than the TMCP steel at 1/4-thickness, whereas it was reduced dramatically at 1/2-thickness. The high intensity of the desired texture {\{}112{\}}{\textless}110{\textgreater} was obtained at 1/2-thickness of the R-IPC steel, while the undesired {\{}411{\}}{\textless}148{\textgreater} was obtained at 1/2-thickness of the TMCP steel, which was responsible for the R-IPC steel superior toughness compared to the TMCP steel. The tensile and yield strengths of the two rolled plates were similar, while the elongation at 1/4-thickness of the R-IPC steel was higher compared to the TMCP steel. The low temperature impact energy of the R-IPC steel was significantly higher compared to the TMCP steel, resulting from finer grain size, higher ferrite fraction and higher area of the {\{}110{\}} texture parallel to the impact direction.},

Today, none of the vast number of DFT approximations show this property. The one exception is the ab initio dft method built upon the optimized effective potential strategy for exchange and correlation. This qualifies as a DFT method because it represents the correlated density as a single determinant and by imposing that condition, generates local exchange and correlation operators which are used in self-consistent solutions of the orbitals and eigenvalues. Such a consistent DFT shares many of the properties of the Dyson equation, but without its frequency dependence and associated complications. The relationship between ab initio dft based on MBPT2 functional and GW method is discussed. Ab initio dft provides a self-consistent, frequency independent, effective independent particle alternative with a local correlation potential. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The competition between dislocation emission and cleavage at a crack tip plays an important role in governing the intrinsic fracture behavior of crystalline materials. This competition is not well understood in magnesium, which has many different combinations of cleavage planes and dislocation slip systems. Here, using both anisotropic linear elastic fracture mechanics theory and atomistic simulations, the emission/cleavage competition in magnesium is evaluated for a comprehensive set of crack orientations and crack tip geometries under mode I crack tip stress intensity loading at T = 0 K. Both theory and simulation show that cleavage is favored in most crack orientations, including basal plane cracks, tensile twin and basal-prismatic plane interface cracks. Initial slight crack tip blunting does not significantly change the behavior. These results suggest that magnesium has extremely low intrinsic fracture toughness, consistent with observations of many different cleavage-like planes in low-temperature fracture experiments. Based on T = 0 K properties, obtaining a more-ductile material via crack tip dislocation emission on the pyramidal and basal slip systems would require substantial and moderate reductions of the unstable stacking fault energy (∼50{\%} and ∼20{\%}, respectively) to be achieved at finite temperatures and/or via alloying.},

abstract = {As a kind of multi-principal component alloy, high-entropy alloy breaks through the design idea of traditional single-principal component alloys, and shows excellent properties different from traditional alloy. It has a good application prospect in extreme environments including high temperature, high pressure and high strain rate. Analyzing the impact deformation characteristics of high entropy alloy from micro, meso and macro scale is of great importance for its engineering application, which includes the influences of the element effect, macrostructure and high temperature and high strain rate conditions on the impact damage evolution, microstructure change and impact deformation evolution process of high entropy alloys. In terms of the effect of elements on the mechanical properties of high entropy alloys, the effect of the great difference between the atomic radius of metal and nonmetal elements on the impact deformation is mainly discussed. According to the micro scale structure, the high entropy microstructure of single-phase alloy can be divided into face centered cubic (FCC) structure with better plasticity and body centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure with higher strength. The microstructure of multiphase high entropy alloy is the combination of these three single-phase structures and other phases. The cooperative deformation of multiphase high entropy alloy ensures it to obtain more excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. High temperature and high strain rate as external conditions exhibit similar effect on the high-entropy alloy and other metals. High temperature promotes material softening, while the high strain rate promotes material hardening. Some high entropy alloys have better mechanical properties at high temperature. According to the impact characteristics of high-entropy alloy, the applications of high-entropy alloy in the field of national defense engineering impact are summarized. The existing problems in the research of impact deformation behavior of high-entropy alloy are analyzed, and the applications of high-entropy alloy in extreme conditions are prospected.},

abstract = {High-entropy and medium-entropy alloys are presumed to have a configurational entropy as high as that of an ideally mixed solid solution (SS) of multiple elements in near-equal proportions. However, enthalpic interactions inevitably render such chemically disordered SSs rare and metastable, except at very high temperatures. Here we highlight the wide variety of local chemical ordering (LCO) that sets these concentrated SSs apart from traditional solvent-solute ones. Using atomistic simulations, we reveal that the LCO of the multi-principal-element NiCoCr SS changes with alloy processing conditions, producing a wide range of generalized planar fault energies. We show that the LCO heightens the ruggedness of the energy landscape and raises activation barriers governing dislocation activities. This influences the selection of dislocation pathways in slip, faulting, and twinning, and increases the lattice friction to dislocation motion via a nanoscale segment detrapping mechanism. In contrast, severe plastic deformation reduces the LCO towards random SS.},

The EMTO kinetic energy, combined with the Coulomb and exchange-correlation terms calculated from the total density, yields the FCD-EMTO total energy. The accuracy of the FCD-EMTO method is demonstrated through several test calculations.},

In recent years, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted tremendous attention in various fields. With multiple principal compo-nents, they inherently possess unique microstructures and many impressive properties, such as high strength and hard-ness, excellent corrosion resistance, thermal stability, fatigue, fracture, and irradiation resistance, in terms of which they overwhelm the traditional alloys. All these properties have endowed HEAs with many promising potential applications. An in-depth understanding of the essence of HEAs is im-portant to further developing numerous HEAs with better properties and performance in the future. In this paper, we review the recent development of HEAs, and summarize their preparation methods, composition design, phase formation and microstructures, various properties, and modeling and simulation calculations. In addition, the future trends and prospects of HEAs are put forward.},

abstract = {Recent works have revealed a unique combination of high strength and high ductility in certain compositions of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which is attributed to the low stacking fault energy (SFE). While atomistic calculations have been successful in predicting the SFE of pure metals, large variations up to 200 mJ/m2 have been observed in HEAs. One of the leading causes of such variations is the limited number of atoms that can be modeled in atomistic calculations; as a result, due to random distribution of elements in HEAs, various nearest neighbor environments may not be adequately captured in small supercells resulting in different SFE values. Such variation further increases with the increase in the number of elements in a given composition. In this work, we use machine learning to overcome the limitation of smaller system sizes and provide a methodology to significantly reduce the variation and uncertainty in predicting SFEs. We show that the SFE can be accurately predicted across the composition ranges in binary alloys. This capability then enables us to predict the SFE of multi-elemental alloys by training the model using only binary alloys. Consequently, SFEs of complex alloys can be predicted using a binary alloys database, and the need to perform calculations for every new composition can be circumvented.},

Notably the Ni-free cobalt-based alloys suffered from starts of catastrophic oxidation in several surface locations. The quaternary alloy bases allowing taking benefit of the best compromise between hot oxidation resistance and possibly good mechanical behavior at elevated temperature was the model alloys with 14–28 wt{\%}Ni.},

Chemical binding energy analysis shows that both boron and hydrogen are able to segregate to the interstices in the Ni phase, Ni3Al phase and Ni/Ni3Al interface. Boron, however, is bound to its neighbor atoms more tightly than hydrogen in both models and its stable state exists over a broader lattice misfit range compared with hydrogen. The bond order analysis we have proposed reveals the origin of the boron-induced ductility and hydrogen-induced embrittlment at the Ni/Ni3Al interface with different lattice misfit. The calculations indicate that hydrogen causes more severe embrittlement at the Ni/Ni3Al interface in Ni3Al-based than in Ni-based alloys. Furthermore, it is found that the boron-induced ductility and hydrogen-induced embrittlement are changed, and thus controllable, by the lattice misfit. Our results provide a quantitative explanation of many experimental phenomena caused by the addition of boron and hydrogen to Ni-based and Ni3Al-based alloys. {\textcopyright} 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

The strength of HEAs is considerably higher than traditional solid solutions, as the many constituents lead to a rugged energy landscape that increases the resistance to dislocation motion, which can also be retarded by other heterogeneities. The wide variety of nanostructured heterogeneities in HEAs, including those generated on the fly during tensile straining, also offer elevated strain-hardening capability that promotes uniform tensile ductility. Citing recent examples, this review explores the multiple levels of heterogeneities in multi-principal-element alloys that contribute to lattice friction and back stress hardening, as a general strategy towards strength–ductility synergy beyond current benchmark ranges.},

abstract = {Understanding the strengthening and deformation mechanisms in refractory high-entropy alloys (HEAs), proposed as new high-temperature material, is required for improving their typically insufficient room-temperature ductility. Here, density-functional theory simulations and a continuum mechanics analysis were conducted to systematically investigate the competition between cleavage decohesion and dislocation emission from a crack tip in the body-centered cubic refractory HEAs HfNbTiZr, MoNbTaVW, MoNbTaW, MoNbTiV, and NbTiVZr. This crack-tip competition is evaluated for tensile loading and a totality of 15 crack configurations and slip systems. Our results predict that dislocation plasticity at the crack tip is generally unfavorable – although the competition is close for some crack orientations, suggesting intrinsic brittleness and low crack-tip fracture toughness in these five HEAs at zero temperature. Fluctuations in local alloy composition, investigated for HfNbTiZr, can locally reduce the resistance to dislocation emission for a slip system relative to the configuration average of that slip system, but do not change the dominant crack-tip response. In the case of single-crystal MoNbTaW, where an experimental, room-temperature fracture-toughness value is available for a crack on a {\{}100{\}} plane, theoretical and experimental results agree favorably. Factors that may limit the agreement are discussed. We survey the effect of material anisotropy on preferred crack tip orientations, which are found to be alloy specific. Mixed-mode loadings are found to shift the competition in favor of cleavage or dislocation nucleation, depending on crack configuration and amplified by the effect of material anisotropy on crack tip stresses.},

abstract = {Compared to decades-old theories of strengthening in dilute solid solutions, the mechanical behavior of concentrated solid solutions is relatively poorly understood. A special subset of these materials includes alloys in which the constituent elements are present in equal atomic proportions, including the high-entropy alloys of recent interest. A unique characteristic of equiatomic alloys is the absence of "solvent" and "solute" atoms, resulting in a breakdown of the textbook picture of dislocations moving through a solvent lattice and encountering discrete solute obstacles. To clarify the mechanical behavior of this interesting new class of materials, we investigate here a family of equiatomic binary, ternary and quaternary alloys based on the elements Fe, Ni, Co, Cr and Mn that were previously shown to be single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc) solid solutions. The alloys were arc-melted, drop-cast, homogenized, cold-rolled and recrystallized to produce equiaxed microstructures with comparable grain sizes. Tensile tests were performed at an engineering strain rate of 10-3s-1at temperatures in the range 77-673 K. Unalloyed fcc Ni was processed similarly and tested for comparison. The flow stresses depend to varying degrees on temperature, with some (e.g. NiCoCr, NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr) exhibiting yield and ultimate strengths that increase strongly with decreasing temperature, while others (e.g. NiCo and Ni) exhibit very weak temperature dependencies. To better understand this behavior, the temperature dependencies of the yield strength and strain hardening were analyzed separately. Lattice friction appears to be the predominant component of the temperature-dependent yield stress, possibly because the Peierls barrier height decreases with increasing temperature due to a thermally induced increase of dislocation width. In the early stages of plastic flow (5-13{\%} strain, depending on material), the temperature dependence of strain hardening is due mainly to the temperature dependence of the shear modulus. In all the equiatomic alloys, ductility and strength increase with decreasing temperature down to 77 K.},

abstract = {Mitigation of global warming is one of the most outstanding issues for the humankind. The Japanese government announced that it will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25{\%} from the 1990 level by 2020 as a medium-term goal. One of the promising approaches to achieving this is to improve the efficiency of thermal power plants emitting one-third of total CO2 gas in Japan. The key to improving the thermal efficiency is high temperature materials with excellent temperature capabilities allowing higher inlet gas temperatures. In this context, new single crystal superalloys for turbine blades and vanes, new coatings and turbine disk superalloys have been successfully developed for various gas turbine applications, typically 1700°C ultra-efficient gas turbines for next generation combine cycle power plants.},

The $\gamma$′ spheres in an NiSiAl alloy had dissolved uniformly into the $\gamma$ matrix during reversion, and some spheres were left in a sparse and random distribution throughout the matrix. In NiSi, NiAl and NiAlTi alloys, however, the cuboidal or plate-like $\gamma$′ particles dissolved very locally into the $\gamma$ matrix during reversion, and some particles were left in groups in the matrix. The elastic interaction energies between the $\gamma$′ precipitates played an essential role in the development of such types of precipitate morphology as the above. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The origin of the Peierls model and its relation to that of Frenkel and Kontorova are described. Within this model there are three essentially different formulae for the stress required to move a dislocation rigidly through a perfect lattice, associated with the names of Peierls, Nabarro and Huntington. There are also three distinct approaches to experimental estimates of the Peierls stress, depending on the Bordoni internal friction peak, the flow stress at low temperatures and Harper-Dorn creep. The results in the case of close-packed metals can be reconciled with the aid of ideas due to Benoit et al. and to Schoeck. The analytical elegance of Peierls's solution depends on the assumption of a sinusoidal law of force across the glide plane. This is physically unrealistic. Foreman et al. and others have obtained interesting results using other laws of force, while still operating in the framework of the Peierls model. The locking-unlocking model extends the ideas to the case in which the dislocation core has two mechanically stable configurations. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

The as-cast ingot was solution treated and then hot extruded. Microstructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Corrosion behavior of the alloy under each condition was studied by hydrogen evolution and quasi in-situ corrosion methods. It has been found that the as-cast alloy is composed of $\alpha$-Mg, stacking faults (SFs) at the outer edge of the matrix grains, and eutectic phase along the grain boundaries. After solution treatment, the SFs disappear and precipitates rich in Zn and Zr elements form in the grain interior and boundaries. The microstructure is significantly refined after extrusion. Hydrogen evolution tests show that the as-cast alloy exhibits the best corrosion resistance, and the solution-treated alloy has the worst corrosion resistance. Corrosion rate of the alloy under each condition decreases first and then increases with prolonging immersion time. Corrosion experiments demonstrate that $\alpha$-Mg was corroded preferentially, the eutectic phase and precipitates exhibit better corrosion resistance. The as-extruded alloy demonstrates uniform corrosion due to fine and homogeneous microstructure.},

abstract = {The tensile properties of CrCoNi, a medium-entropy alloy, have been shown to be significantly better than those of CrMnFeCoNi, a high-entropy alloy. To understand the deformation mechanisms responsible for its superiority, tensile tests were performed on CrCoNi at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) and room temperature (293 K) and interrupted at different strains. Microstructural analyses by transmission electron microscopy showed that, during the early stage of plasticity, deformation occurs by the glide of 1/2{\textless}110{\textgreater} dislocations dissociated into 1/6{\textless}112{\textgreater} Shockley partials on {\{}111{\}} planes, similar to the behavior of CrMnFeCoNi. Measurements of the partial separations yielded a stacking fault energy of 22 ± 4 mJ m−2, which is ∼25{\%} lower than that of CrMnFeCoNi. With increasing strain, nanotwinning appears as an additional deformation mechanism in CrCoNi. The critical resolved shear stress for twinning in CrCoNi with 16 $\mu$m grain size is 260 ± 30 MPa, roughly independent of temperature, and comparable to that of CrMnFeCoNi having similar grain size. However, the yield strength and work hardening rate of CrCoNi are higher than those of CrMnFeCoNi. Consequently, the twinning stress is reached earlier (at lower strains) in CrCoNi. This in turn results in an extended strain range where nanotwinning can provide high, steady work hardening, leading to the superior mechanical properties (ultimate strength, ductility, and toughness) of medium-entropy CrCoNi compared to high-entropy CrMnFeCoNi.},

abstract = {Materials with low stacking fault energies have been long sought for their many desirable mechanical attributes. Although there have been many suc- cessful reports of low stacking fault alloys (for example Cu-based and Mg- based), many have lacked sufficient strength to be relevant for structural applications. The recent discovery and development of multicomponent equi- atomic alloys (or high-entropy alloys) that form as simple solid solutions on ideal lattices has opened the door to investigate changes in stacking fault energy in materials that naturally exhibit high mechanical strength. We re- port in this article our efforts to determine the stacking fault energies of two- to five-component alloys. A range of methods that include ball milling, arc melting, and casting, is used to synthesize the alloys. The resulting structure of the alloys is determined from x-ray diffraction measurements. First-prin- ciples electronic structure calculations are employed to determine elastic constants, lattice parameters, and Poisson's ratios for the same alloys. These values are then used in conjunction with x-ray diffraction measurements to quantify stacking fault energies as a function of the number of components in the equiatomic alloys. We show that the stacking fault energies decrease with the number of components. Nonequiatomic alloys are also explored as a means to further reduce stacking fault energy. We show that this strategy leads to a means to further reduce the stacking fault energy in this class of alloys.},

Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain. Abstract: In conventional metallic materials, strength and ductility are mutually exclusive, referred to as strength-ductility trade-off. Here, we demonstrate an approach to improve the strength and ductility simultaneously by introducing micro-banding and the accumulation of a high density of dislocations in single-phase high-entropy alloys (HEAs). We prepare two compositions (Cr 10 Mn 50 Fe 20 Co 10 Ni 10 and Cr 10 Mn 10 Fe 60 Co 10 Ni 10) with distinctive different stacking fault energies (SFEs) as experimental materials. The strength and ductility of the Cr 10 Mn 50 Fe 20 Co 10 Ni 10 HEA are improved concurrently by grain refinement from 347.5±216.1 µm to 18.3±9.3 µm. The ultimate tensile strength increases from 543±4 MPa to 621±8 MPa and the elongation to failure enhances from 43±2{\%} to 55±1{\%}. To reveal the underlying deformation mechanisms responsible for such a strength-ductility synergy, the microstructural evolution upon loading is investigated by electron microscopy techniques. The dominant deformation mechanism observed for the Cr 10 Mn 50 Fe 20 Co 10 Ni 10 HEA is the activation of micro-bands, which act both as dislocation sources and dislocation barriers, eventually, leading to the formation of dislocation cell structures. By decreasing grain size, much finer dislocation cell structures develop, which are responsible for the improvement in work hardening rate at higher strains ({\textgreater}7 {\%}) and thus for the increase in both strength and ductility. In order to drive guidelines for designing advanced HEAs by tailoring their SFE and grain size, we compute the SFEs of Cr 10 Mn x Fe 70-x Co 10 Ni 10 (10 ≤ x ≤ 60) based on first principles calculations. Based on these results the overall changes on deformation mechanism can be explained by the influence of Mn on the SFE.},

abstract = {High entropy alloys based on the Ta–Nb–Mo–Cr–Ti–Al system are expected to possess high creep and oxidation resistance as well as outstanding specific mechanical properties due to presumed high melting points and low densities. However, we recently reported that arc-melted and subsequently homogenized alloys within this system exhibit a lack of ductility up to 600 °C [H. Chen et al. in Metall. Mater. Trans. A 49 (2018) 772–781 and J. Alloys Cmpd. 661 (2016) 206–215]. Thermodynamic calculations suggest the formation of a B2-type ordered phase below the homogenization temperature. In the present article, we provide results of a detailed microstructural characterization of a series of Ta–Nb–Mo–Cr–Ti–Al derivatives and evaluate if B2-type ordering could be the origin for the observed lack of ductility. Backscatter electron (BSE) imaging, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) were used to verify uniform elemental distribution after homogenization. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate both, A2 or B2-type crystal structure, whereas transmission electron microscopy (TEM) diffraction experiments unambiguously confirm B2-type order in the as-homogenized state of all investigated alloys. In MoCrTiAl, planar defects that show antiphase boundary contrast with a {\{}100{\}}-type habit plane were detected by TEM dark field (DF) imaging. They are wetted by a Cr-enriched and Ti-depleted layer as confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-EDX line scans as well as APT analyses. The planar defects arise from a disorder-order solid-state phase transformation during cooling, as indicated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).},

abstract = {BCC refractory high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are of interest to the materials science community due to their promising high temperature properties. Stacking fault energy (SFE) is investigated in the present work due to its use in modeling mechanical and deformation behavior, such as nano-twinning. The possible stacking faults of the BCC {\{}112{\}} plane are reviewed and classified with a new naming convention of TSn,twinning sense, and NTSn,non-twinning sense. Five stacking faults are identified and investigated in the present work. Density functional theory and special quasirandom structures are used to calculate the SFE of a candidate single-phase BCC AlNbTaTiV HEA. The SFE for each fault are calculated for several pure elements and compared to computational and experimental literature when available. Inferential statistics allows the properties of the total population to be predicted from a sample set of calculations. The results indicate that a sample of only 20 values are required for precise calculations. Inferential statistics are then used to place predictive error bars on the HEA SFE calculations and sampling procedure. All sample SFE values were well within the predictive error bars when compared to the SFE calculated from the total population. Finally, inferential statistics parameters are used to predict the properties of a global population based on a sample set of calculations, demonstrating the usefulness of the technique developed here for application to materials property database generation.},

abstract = {To study the effects of twin boundary and high-entropy on elastic–plastic behavior of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), molecular dynamics (MD) was employed to simulate the nanoindentation on single-crystal CoCrNiFeMn HEA (sc-HEA), twinned CoCrNiFeMn HEA (tw-HEA) bicrystal and twinned Ni (tw-Ni) bicrystal. The deformation behaviors of the three samples were then compared with each other. Simulations revealed that the load-drop phenomenon during the indentation in the HEAs is not so apparent as that in the Ni. Microstructure characterization showed that a dense dislocation network was localized below the indentation pit of the HEAs. These phenomena are related to the damping spreading behavior of dislocations underneath the indenter. Through the analysis of the plastic zone underneath the indentation, it is found that the twin boundary inhibits dislocation penetration, and moreover, provides a slipping path for dislocations. The radial distribution of dislocation density proves that dislocations in the indentation of the HEAs are more concentrated than that in the traditional metals. Understanding the sluggish dislocation behavior and twin boundary effect help understand the deformation mechanisms underlying the mechanical response of HEAs.},

@book{Sheikh2018,
abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) comprise of multi-principal elements in equi-atomic or near equi-atomic percentage. HEAs are considered as potential structural materials for high temperature applications, which require alloy design for optimum mechanical properties. In this regard, achieving both high strength and tensile ductility is still a great challenge. Compared to conventional alloys, HEAs have high configurational entropy, which tends to stabilize the solid solution formation, mainly face-centered-cubic (fcc) and/or body-centered-cubic (bcc) solid solutions. Generally, fcc-type HEAs are ductile but soft, while bcc-type HEAs are hard but brittle. This project has three working directions. The first part of this work is related to alloy design and aims to gain improved understanding of the solid solubility in HEAs. The difficulties that are encountered by HEAs are mostly related to the alloy design strategy. Previous approaches to describe the solid solubilities in HEAs could not accurately locate the solubility limit. Therefore, the need for single-phase solid solution and controlling the formation of secondary phases is addressed through the molecular orbital approach. The output of this approach is the introduction of the Md parameter, the d-orbital energy level to HEAs, which can well describe the solubility limit in HEAs. To further develop this approach, Md is also complemented with theoretical methods specifically, CALPHAD and experimental work. The second part of this work is to ductilize HEAs containing group IV (Ti, Zr, Hf), V (V, Nb, Ta) and VI (Cr, Mo, W) refractory elements, known as refractory HEAs (RHEAs), where inadequate ductility puts a limit on their mechanical performance for structural applications. A strategy is proposed to design RHEAs with sufficient yield strength combined with ductility at room temperature. Ductility is introduced by maintaining the bcc single-phase solid solution and keeping the number of total valence electrons low, which can be achieved through controlled alloying. More importantly, a mechanism and route for ductilizing RHEAs is proposed. The third part, which is the ultimate goal of this work, is to address the balance of mechanical properties and oxidation resistance for RHEAs, for the optimal development of RHEAs aiming at high-temperature applications. Based on the known facts for refractory alloys, the oxidation resistance is also problematic for RHEAs and there exists only limited work towards the study of high temperature oxidation of ductile RHEAs. Therefore, the oxidation mechanism is studied and it is found out that the insufficient oxidation resistance in existing ductile RHEAs is attributed to the failure in forming protective oxide scales accompanied by the accelerated internal oxidation leading to pest-disintegration or pesting. Efforts are also carried out to improve oxidation resistance via alloying and pack-cementation aluminizing. These studies provide important input to the further development of RHEAs as novel high-temperature materials and shed light on the design of refractory HEAs with optimal mechanical and oxidation resistance properties.},

abstract = {Molecular statics and molecular dynamics simulations are presented for the structure and glide motion of a/2〈111〉 dislocations in a randomly-distributed model-BCC Co16.67Fe36.67Ni16.67Ti30 alloy. Core structure variations along an individual dislocation line are found for a/2〈111〉 screw and edge dislocations. One reason for the core structure variations is the local variation in composition along the dislocation line. Calculated unstable stacking fault energies on the (110) plane as a function of composition vary significantly, consistent with this assessment. Molecular dynamics simulations of the critical glide stress as a function of temperature show significant strengthening, and much shallower temperature dependence of the strengthening, as compared to pure BCC Fe as well as a reference mean-field BCC alloy material of the same overall composition, lattice and elastic constants as the target alloy. Interpretation of the strength versus temperature in terms of an effective kink-pair activation model shows the random alloy to have a much larger activation energy than the mean-field alloy or BCC Fe. This is interpreted as due to the core structure variations along the dislocation line that are often unfavorable for glide in the direction of the load. The configuration of the gliding dislocation is wavy, and significant debris is left behind, demonstrating the role of local composition and core structure in creating kink pinning (super jogs) and/or deflection of the glide plane of the dislocation.},

This finding is surprising because plastic flows in BCC elemental metals and dilute alloys are generally controlled by screw dislocations.

abstract = {This paper presents a two-step Bayesian framework for the estimation of the intrinsic single crystal elastic stiffness parameters from the measurements of spherical indentation stress-strain responses in multiple individual grains of a polycrystalline sample, whose crystal lattice orientations have been measured using electron back-scattered diffraction technique. The first step requires the establishment of the functional dependence of the indentation elastic modulus given the lattice orientation and the intrinsic single crystal elastic stiffness parameters. Previous efforts for this step required a large database of computationally expensive finite element (FE) simulations in order to establish this function with adequate accuracy. In this paper, it is shown that the introduction of a Bayesian framework can greatly reduce the number of simulations necessary to establish this function, while introducing practically useful measures of uncertainty which can guide the selection of specific additional simulations that are expected to best improve the predictive accuracy of the function. The second step involves a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the distribution of possible values for the single crystal elastic stiffness parameters based on a given set of experimentally measured elastic indentation moduli in individual grains of different lattice orientations. This second step is accomplished by calibrating the available experimental data to the function established in the first step. This novel framework is presented and demonstrated in this paper for an as-cast cubic polycrystalline Fe-3{\%} Si sample and a hexagonal polycrystalline commercially pure (CP-Ti) titanium sample.},

abstract = {By adjusting thermomechanical controlled processing parameters, different microstructures were obtained in a low carbon Mn-Mo-Nb pipeline steel. The microstructural characteristic and its effect on low temperature toughness were investigated. The results show that under higher reduction in austenite non-recrystallisation region and faster cooling rate during accelerated cooling, the microstructure is dominated by acicular ferrite (AF) accompanied by a small amount of fine martensite/austenite (M/A) islands. In contrast, lower reduction and slower cooling rate lead to a predominantly quasi-polygonal ferrite microstructure with coarse M/A islands. The fine effective grain size (EGS) and the high fraction of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) make the cleavage crack propagation direction deflect frequently. The coarse M/A islands can lead to cleavage microcracks at the M-A/ferrite matrix interfaces. Compared with the microstructure mainly consisting of quasi-polygonal ferrite, the microstructure dominated by AF exhibits excellent low temperature toughness because of fine EGS, high fraction of HAGBs and fine M/A islands. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.},

abstract = {Oxygen, one of the most abundant elements on Earth, often forms an undesired interstitial impurity or ceramic phase (such as an oxide particle) in metallic materials. Even when it adds strength, oxygen doping renders metals brittle1–3. Here we show that oxygen can take the form of ordered oxygen complexes, a state in between oxide particles and frequently occurring random interstitials. Unlike traditional interstitial strengthening4,5, such ordered interstitial complexes lead to unprecedented enhancement in both strength and ductility in compositionally complex solid solutions, the so-called high-entropy alloys (HEAs)6–10. The tensile strength is enhanced (by 48.5 ± 1.8 per cent) and ductility is substantially improved (by 95.2 ± 8.1 per cent) when doping a model TiZrHfNb HEA with 2.0 atomic per cent oxygen, thus breaking the long-standing strength–ductility trade-off11. The oxygen complexes are ordered nanoscale regions within the HEA characterized by (O, Zr, Ti)-rich atomic complexes whose formation is promoted by the existence of chemical short-range ordering among some of the substitutional matrix elements in the HEAs. Carbon has been reported to improve strength and ductility simultaneously in face-centred cubic HEAs12, by lowering the stacking fault energy and increasing the lattice friction stress. By contrast, the ordered interstitial complexes described here change the dislocation shear mode from planar slip to wavy slip, and promote double cross-slip and thus dislocation multiplication through the formation of Frank–Read sources (a mechanism explaining the generation of multiple dislocations) during deformation. This ordered interstitial complex-mediated strain-hardening mechanism should be particularly useful in Ti-, Zr- and Hf-containing alloys, in which interstitial elements are highly undesirable owing to their embrittlement effects, and in alloys where tuning the stacking fault energy and exploiting athermal transformations13 do not lead to property enhancement. These results provide insight into the role of interstitial solid solutions and associated ordering strengthening mechanisms in metallic materials.},

Here we develop an approach to quantify the dependence of generalized stacking fault energies on the degree of chemical disorder in multicomponent alloys. We introduce the notion of a "configurationally- resolved planar fault" (CRPF) energy and extend the cluster expansion method from alloy theory to express the CRPF as a function of chemical occupation variables of sites surrounding the fault. We apply the approach to explore the composition and temperature dependence of the unstable stacking fault energy (USF) in binary Mo-Nb alloys. First-principles calculations are used to parameterize a formation energy and CRPF cluster expansion. Monte Carlo simulations show that the distribution of USF energies is significantly affected by chemical composition and temperature. The formalism can be applied to any multicomponent alloy and will enable the development of rigorous models for deformation mechanisms in high-entropy alloys.},

abstract = {The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) is a high-throughput database currently consisting of nearly 300,000 density functional theory (DFT) total energy calculations of compounds from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and decorations of commonly occurring crystal structures. To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of ∼3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.},

abstract = {Interface engineering usually imposes a trade-off between catalytic activity, product selectivity, and property tunability, facilitating multiple product yields. Due to their structural disorder, metal grain boundaries (GBs) can be constructed to satisfy all of these conditions. Though experiments show GB catalytic footprints are determined by dislocation-induced elastic strain, the atomistic structural and energetic origins of GB catalytic performance are not currently known. In former models solely reviewing metastable GBs defined by macroscopic degrees of freedom (DOFs), exceptional low-$\Sigma$ GBs anticipated by the coincident site lattice model cannot be consistently discerned. Herein, a structure-energy correlation linking changes in atomistic properties to physical models is developed, distinguishing exceptional GBs from unexceptional high-angle GBs over structural DOFs. This work constructs particular GB elastic responses by varying three microscopic DOFs, comparing low-$\Sigma$ distinguished and other GB responses via a directed statistical approach. Such elastic properties successfully distinguish low-$\Sigma$ GBs from high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) by their strain-related footprints without failure of a single unique GB structure and composition combination. A priori application of machine learning classification is completed using metastable GB and elastic response related properties. This classification not only validates distinguished strain footprints, but also identifies GB subgroups with footprints unexpected by former models.},

However, most metallurgical mechanisms for increasing strength lead to ductility loss, an effect referred to as the strength-ductility trade-off. Here we present a metastability-engineering strategy in which we design nanostructured, bulk high-entropy alloys with multiple compositionally equivalent high-entropy phases. High-entropy alloys were originally proposed to benefit from phase stabilization through entropy maximization. Yet here, motivated by recent work that relaxes the strict restrictions on high-entropy alloy compositions by demonstrating the weakness of this connection, the concept is overturned. We decrease phase stability to achieve two key benefits: interface hardening due to a dual-phase microstructure (resulting from reduced thermal stability of the high-temperature phase); and transformation-induced hardening (resulting from the reduced mechanical stability of the room-temperature phase). This combines the best of two worlds: extensive hardening due to the decreased phase stability known from advanced steels and massive solid-solution strengthening of high-entropy alloys. In our transformation-induced plasticity-assisted, dual-phase high-entropy alloy (TRIP-DP-HEA), these two contributions lead respectively to enhanced trans-grain and inter-grain slip resistance, and hence, increased strength. Moreover, the increased strain hardening capacity that is enabled by dislocation hardening of the stable phase and transformation-induced hardening of the metastable phase produces increased ductility. This combined increase in strength and ductility distinguishes the TRIP-DP-HEA alloy from other recently developed structural materials. This metastability-engineering strategy should thus usefully guide design in the near-infinite compositional space of high-entropy alloys.},

abstract = {The impact of a concentrated solid solution on the deformation mechanisms of a bcc multi-principal elements alloy is investigated. The room temperature mechanical properties in tension and simple shear are studied on samples with controlled microstructure. The partition of the various stress components is performed, as well as the determination of the activation volumes and the analysis of the dislocation density and velocity. The study of the mechanical behavior is coupled to a complete TEM investigation. The alloy displays a high yield strength that is explained by a strong impact of the short-range obstacles to the dislocation glide, with an enhancement of the effective stress due to the concentrated solid solution. The increase of the backstress is related to the formation of a heterogeneous dislocation structure, with dense dislocation bands acting as long-range obstacles. Deformation is controlled by screw dislocation glide. The a/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocations are rectilinear, indicating a high lattice friction effect. Evolution of both dislocation velocity and density during multirelaxation transients suggests a low mobility. If activation volumes are consistent with a Peierls mechanism, other considerations rather head towards the hypothesis of a transitory regime where the solid solution could impact further the dislocation glide.},

Estimates of this type are established in the second pan of the paper for ill-posed parameter identification problems arising in inverse groundwater hydrology. Both transient and steady-state data are investigated. Finally, the numerical performance of the new Levenberg-Marquardt scheme is studied and compared to a usual implementation on a realistic but synthetic two-dimensional model problem from the engineering literature.},

abstract = {An algorithm is presented for carrying out decomposition of electronic charge density into atomic contributions. As suggested by Bader [R. Bader, Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory, Oxford University Press, New York, 1990], space is divided up into atomic regions where the dividing surfaces are at a minimum in the charge density, i.e. the gradient of the charge density is zero along the surface normal. Instead of explicitly finding and representing the dividing surfaces, which is a challenging task, our algorithm assigns each point on a regular (x, y, z) grid to one of the regions by following a steepest ascent path on the grid. The computational work required to analyze a given charge density grid is approximately 50 arithmetic operations per grid point. The work scales linearly with the number of grid points and is essentially independent of the number of atoms in the system. The algorithm is robust and insensitive to the topology of molecular bonding. In addition to two test problems involving a water molecule and NaCl crystal, the algorithm has been used to estimate the electrical activity of a cluster of boron atoms in a silicon crystal. The highly stable three-atom boron cluster, B3I is found to have a charge of -1.5 e, which suggests approximately 50{\%} reduction in electrical activity as compared with three substitutional boron atoms. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Highlights of the research are as follows: ? The roles of transition element dopants in affecting oxidation resistance of ZrB2 ultra-high temperature ceramics, through the effects of the dopants on sintering and/or stability of the oxidation products (ZrO2, B-O glasses, and B-Si-O glasses), were elucidated through experiments and atomistic calculations. ? Structure, oxidation behavior, and stability of HfSiCNO ceramics were determined by experiment and atomistic calculations. The potential for beneficial oxidation reactions to form “self-healing” layers containing compounds that are resistant to water vapor erosion was explored. ? Two new experimental methods were developed for characterizing fiber architectures in ceramic matrix composites and observing/measuring the evolution of damage under load at high temperatures, above 1500°C. One method uses digital surface image correlation and the other uses synchrotron x-ray micro tomography, which is capable of micron-scale resolution in 3-dimensional images. ? Under the umbrella of a virtual test system, methods were developed for: (i) analyzing 3-dimensional images of microstructures of fiber reinforced composites to create statistical characterization of the microstructure, (ii) formulation of a probabilistic generator for creating virtual specimens that replicate the measured statistics, and (iii) creation of a computational model for a virtual specimen that allows representation of discrete damage events. Computational methods included new probabilistic algorithms for generating stochastic virtual specimens and a new Augmented Finite Element Method (A-FEM) that yields extreme efficiency in dealing with arbitrary cracking in such heterogeneous materials.},

abstract = {Bulk metallic materials have ordinarily been produced by melting and solidification processes for the last several thousand years. However, metallic liquid is unstable at temperatures below the melting temperature and solidifies immediately into crystalline phases. Consequently, all bulk engineering alloys are composed of a crystalline structure. Recently, this common concept was exploded by the findings of the stabilization phenomenon of the supercooled liquid for a number of alloys in the Mg-, lanthanide-, Zr-, Ti-, Fe-, Co-, Pd-Cu- and Ni-based systems. The alloys with the stabilized supercooled liquid state have three features in their alloy components, i.e. multicomponent systems, significant atomic size ratios above 12{\%}, and negative heats of mixing. The stabilization mechanism has also been investigated from experimental data of structure analyses and fundamental physical properties. The stabilization has enabled the production of bulk amorphous alloys in the thickness range of 1-100 mm by using various casting processes. Bulk amorphous Zr-based alloys exhibit high mechanical strength, high fracture toughness and good corrosion resistance and have been used for sporting goods materials. The stabilization also leads to the appearance of a large supercooled liquid region before crystallization and enables high-strain rate super-plasticity through Newtonian flow. The new Fe- and Co-based amorphous alloys exhibit a large super-cooled liquid region and good soft magnetic properties which are characterized by low coercive force and high permeability. Furthermore, homogeneous dispersion of nanoscale particles into Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys was found to cause an improvement of tensile strength without detriment to good ductility. The discovery of the stabilization phenomenon, followed by the clarification of the stabilization criteria of the supercooled liquid, will promise the future definite development of bulk amorphous alloys as new basic science and engineering materials.},

The Ti0.5ZrNbTaMo HEA exhibited a high hardness of about 500 HV, high compressive strength approaching 2,600 MPa, and large plastic strain of over 30{\%}. Furthermore, the highly-protective oxide films formed on the surface of Ti–Zr–Nb–Ta–Mo HEAs in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution, which resulted in the high corrosion resistance of the HEAs. The Ti–Zr–Nb–Ta–Mo HEAs exhibited the greater dry- and wet-wear resistance than that of the traditional biomedical Ti6Al4V alloy. The results also indicated that with the decrease in the Ti content, the wear resistance of the Ti–Zr–Nb–Ta–Mo HEAs in the PBS solution improved. Finally, the Ti0.5ZrNbTaMo alloy presented the highest corrosive wear resistance among the four HEAs owing to its combination of good mechanical properties and high chemical stability.},

abstract = {The effect of hydrogen on the mechanical behaviour of UNS N07718 (alloy 718) and UNS N07716 (alloy 625 + ) nickel based super-alloys was studied. Atomic hydrogen was introduced into the metal during Slow Strain Rate Tests (SSRTs) via an electrochemical technique, following the method described in [1], this is a standard used in the oil and gas industry to assess the performance of precipitation hardened nickel based alloys towards hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Different heat treatment conditions, used to produce different microstructures, were selected to highlight the effect of specific microstructural phases/ features on the HE susceptibility, including: a Solution Annealed (SA) microstructure, a microstructure with a high volume fraction of delta phase ($\delta$), a microstructure containing low volume fraction of gamma prime ($\gamma$') and gamma double-prime ($\gamma$''), the As Received material (AR) and a Coarse Grain Size (CGZ) microstructure. For each microstructural condition, the mechanical performance under electrochemical hydrogenating conditions was compared against that obtained in an inert (glycerol) environment to evaluate and quantify the susceptibility to HE. In addition, an analysis of fracture surfaces was carried out to assess the preferential mode of fracture. Results revealed that in low magnification images the Hydrogen charged samples showed smooth featureless areas on the fracture surface. HE susceptibility was seen to increase as the volume fraction of the precipitates increased whilst grain size had negligible effect. 625 + displayed higher susceptibility to HE compared to 718.},

The method is illustrated with the Ising model in a square lattice, and the following are presented: (a) an angle-shaped (or a V-shaped) basic cluster of three points can give the same result as a square basic cluster; (b) a general case is formulated in which a zigzag shape of n Vs is used as the basic cluster; and (c) the case of the W cluster (two Vs) is calculated using the general formulation mentioned above. It is shown that, when they are plotted against the reciprocal of the number of points in a cluster, the Curie points calculated by different methods lie very close to a straight line.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Some forensic in situ investigations, such as those needed in transportation (for aviation, maritime, road, or rail accidents) or for parts working under harsh conditions (e.g., pipes or turbines) would benefit from a method/technique that distinguishes ductile from brittle fractures of metals—as material defects are one of the potential causes of incidents. Nowadays, the gold standard in material studies is represented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, SEM instruments are large, expensive, time-consuming, and lab-based; hence, in situ measurements are impossible. To tackle these issues, we propose as an alternative, lower-cost, sufficiently high-resolution technique, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to perform fracture analysis by obtaining the topography of metallic surfaces. Several metals have been considered in this study: low soft carbon steels, lamellar graphite cast iron, an antifriction alloy, high-quality rolled steel, stainless steel, and ductile cast iron. An in-house developed Swept Source (SS) OCT system, Master-Slave (MS) enhanced is used, and height profiles of the samples' surfaces were generated. Two configurations were used: one where the dimension of the voxel was 1000 µm3and a second one of 160 µm3—with a 10 µm and a 4 µm transversal resolution, respectively. These height profiles allowed for concluding that the carbon steel samples were subject to ductile fracture, while the cast iron and antifriction alloy samples were subjected to brittle fracture. The validation of OCT images has been made with SEM images obtained with a 4 nm resolution. Although the OCT images are of a much lower resolution than the SEM ones, we demonstrate that they are sufficiently good to obtain clear images of the grains of the metallic materials and thus to distinguish between ductile and brittle fractures—especially with the higher resolution MS/SS-OCT system. The investigation is finally extended to the most useful case of fatigue fracture of metals, and we demonstrate that OCT is able to replace SEM for such investigations as well.},

abstract = {In this article, molecular dynamics and statics-based simulations were carried out to study the effect of equi-atomic and non-equi-atomic compositions of multi-elemental alloys on defect dynamics and tensile deformation. High and medium entropy alloy configurations were subjected to uni-axial tensile loading, and deformation governing mechanism was identified with the help of dislocation extraction algorithm and common neighbour analysis. Due to low or negative stacking fault energy, phase transformation from FCC to HCP in conjunction with solid solution hardening was identified as the governing mechanism for the plastic deformation in most of the multi-elemental alloys. Atomistic snapshots of simulation box containing deformed configurations of medium and high entropy alloys also show heterogenous nucleation, pinning of dislocations, cross channelling of twin boundaries. It was predicted that in alloys with higher Cr content twinning and stacking fault is prominent mode of deformation. Nudged elastic band algorithm was used to predict the vacancy migration energies in each of the atomistic configurations. The results presented in the article are in qualitatively in agreement with the experimental results, and higher fidelity simulations helps in developing better understanding about the plastic deformation in equi and non-equi-atomic composition of multi-elemental alloys.},

Current understanding of the stability of the sigma phase is largely based on the valence electron concentration (VEC) criterion. Here, we show that VEC alone is insufficient to describe its stability. A second criterion for sigma phase formation based on alloy composition is proposed. A new parameter called paired sigma-forming element (PSFE) content is invented to quantify this criterion. If PSFE content is lower than the threshold value, the sigma phase will not form even if the VEC is correct.},

abstract = {As a fundamental concept, lattice distortion is one of the four core effects in high entropy alloys (HEAs). However, there were few experimental evidences that directly observed the lattice distortion in HEAs. In this work, the experimental observation of lattice distortion in a new developed Fe33Mn13Co22Cr15Ni17 HEA by multiple tilting selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was reported. SAED observation of 51 zone axes were performed in a single grain of the HEA sample. Among them, 24 normal diffraction patterns and 27 anomalous diffraction patterns with extra diffraction spots around the normal reflection spots were observed. According to the proportional relationship between the extra diffraction spots and the normal ones, the extra diffraction spots could be indexed with three non-integral Miller indices. The anomalous diffraction patterns were considered as the effect of reciprocal space lattice distortion, resulting in a relrod extension on the order of half of the reciprocal space lattice constant. The existence of numerous extended reciprocal relrod suggested that serious lattice distortion occurred in concerned HEA, and it significantly affected the transformation from direct lattice to reciprocal lattice.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop and validate an instrument to measure the progression of clinical practice ability among surgical trainees. Study Design: Prospective validation study. Setting: Three academic training institutions: Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health. Subjects and Methods: A clinical practice instrument (CPI) was created and prospectively validated in otolaryngology trainees at three institutional sites. The instrument is completed during an oral examination of a trainee who is presented with a patient scenario; the scenario yields one clinical diagnosis, one therapeutic intervention, and one interventional complication. On the basis of the trainee's responses, 21 item scores are calculated focusing on key areas within the diagnostic and management paradigm. Internal consistency, reproducibility, inter-rater reliability, discriminant and criterion validity, and responsiveness to change over time were evaluated. Results: There were 87 administrations of the instrument over a period of 22 months. The subjects (n = 32) spanned the range of training from medical student to clinical fellow. There was strong internal consistency within each domain (Cronbach's alpha 0.85-0.94, one-sided 95{\%} confidence interval {\textgreater} 0.81). Inter-rater reliability was high (kappa 0.66, absolute agreement 72{\%}). Reproducibility of item scores was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] final summary score 0.78, global item score 0.83). Discriminant validity (P {\textless} 0.0001), criterion validity (P = 0.03), and responsiveness to change (P = 0.0055) were also established. Conclusion: The CPI serves as a reliable, reproducible, and valid means to measure the progression of clinical practice ability in trainees as they transition from "novice" to "attending equivalent" surgeons. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.},

abstract = {Valence electron concentration (VEC), Pugh's ratio (B/G), lattice distortion ($\delta$), and intrinsic ductility (D) are few of the empirical parameters widely used to design ductile refractory alloys. However, the D is the only parameter which considers the relative competition between cracking (surface energy, $\gamma$s) and the barrier to dislocation motion (unstable stacking fault energy, $\gamma$us fe). Here we studied the enthalpy of formation (∆Ef), Root-mean-squared Lattice Distortion (RLD), and D of 9 refractory metals and 36 equiatomic refractory alloys using density functional theory simulations. A sinusoidal formulation of barrier to the glide of slip planes based on $\gamma$us fe has been developed. A strong inverse correlation between D and the maximum barrier to slip plane glide has been found. We found that the dislocation core width is not influenced by the $\gamma$us fe of refractory metals. The RLD is 9{\%} of the dislocation core width, which may not be large enough to affect the dislocation line. However, the local ∆Ef variation along the dislocation line influences the local $\gamma$us fe, leading to a wavy dislocation line. We found that positive ∆Ef and atomic size difference leads to RLD, which does not necessarily require large compositional complexity as of high-entropy alloys. The D and the barrier to slip plane glide correctly captures the experimentally observed ductility in refractory alloys. We found that the success of VEC, lattice distortion, and D in designing ductile refractory alloys was dependent on the underlying ∆Ef of the alloy. Here we provide a universal method to design a ductile refractory alloys which can be thermodynamically stable.},

Backscattered electron (BSE) microscopy, quantitative metallography, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to characterize the morphology, volume fraction, composition, and crystallography of individual phases in the microstructure. The fracture toughness of the composites was characterized by three-point bending and compact-tension techniques, while the fracture toughness of individual phases in the in-situ composites was determined by an indentation technique. The composition, crystallography, and volume fraction of individual phases were correlated with the fracture-toughness results to assess (1) the role of constituent properties in the overall fracture resistance of the composites and (2) the effectiveness of the computational design approach. The results indicated that the effects of alloy addition and plastic constraint on fracture toughness were reasonably predicted, but the conditions for relaxing plastic constraint to attain higher fracture toughness were not achieved.},

abstract = {Generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) is an important property in understanding the plastic deformations of metals. However, the traditional way to calculate it one by one is not efficient, this work introduces a high-throughput workflow to calculate GSFEs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. Based on open-source computational tools from the Materials Project infrastructure, this computation framework automates the procedure of building perfect and faulted slab models with certain orientations, performing DFT simulations and extracting the results into database. The computed GSFEs from this work and ductility parameter based on the GSFE are consistent with reported data from previous literatures, validating the accuracy of our results and algorithm. Such a GSFE workflow may speed up the development and understanding of the mechanical properties of metals or alloys by enabling the computations of GSFEs in an automatic and high-throughput way.},

However, first-principles calculations show that alloying with group IV or V transition metals can transform these materials into ones that display intrinsically ductile behavior, failing in shear under [100] tension.

This paper concerns the prediction of this stress for a wide range of crystals, using a new theoretical Peierls stress equation. It is shown that the prediction is in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Comparison with atomistic calculations illustrates that the accuracy of the prediction may degenerate greatly in the cases where the spreading of the dislocation core is non-planar and the application of an external stress changes the core structure significantly. It is suggested that the magnitude of the Peierls stress is determined primarily by the geometrical configuration of the dislocation core.},

Thus, Chapters 1 to 4 have been considerably expanded to include descriptions of amuch larger number of inorganic and organic crystal structures, together with their point and space group symmetry. Chapters 9 and 10 have updated treatments ofX-ray diffraction whilst Chapter 11 has been expanded to include descriptions of Kikuchi and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Chapter 13 is new and introduces the basic formalism of Fourier analysis in X-ray crystallography and image formation. I find it very easy to recommend this text, without any hesitation. ChristopherHammond is a well-rounded academic i.e. he is a first-rate teacher and a researcher of distinction. His style of presentation is lucid and the book contains some excellent exercises to “stretch” the minds of students needing to acquire a facility with crystallography and diffraction. One particularly charming feature of this book arises because of Christopher Hammond's significant interest in history, name- ly a much expanded Appendix 3. This Appendix gives short biographical notes on all the crystallographers and other scientists mentioned in the body of the book.},

To reach this goal we have developed a materials database covering the main mechanical properties of HEAs and CCAs from the published literature. The database is used to represent various property spaces enabling an assessment of their performance for light weight structures and high-temperature structural applications. In addition, we illustrate the effects of alloying and of specific elements on the room temperature mechanical properties of HEAs and CCAs. With densities between titanium alloys and steels or nickel alloys, the best CCAs exceed commercial alloys in uniaxial loading and beam bending at room temperature. Where use temperature or cost excludes commercial alloys based on Mg, Al or Ti, the best CCAs also offer attractive specific yield strength in panel bending and specific stiffness for all loading conditions at room temperature. Many CCAs have superior structural properties at elevated temperatures.},

Limited compressive plasticity and quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature suggest that the ductile-to-brittle transition for these alloys occurs above room temperature. At 600 °C and above, both alloys showed extensive compressive plastic strain. The yield stress of both alloys dropped by 30–40{\%} between room temperature and 600 °C, but was relatively insensitive to temperature above 600 °C, comparing favorably with conventional superalloys.},

abstract = {To analyze the good toughness of ultrafine ferrite/cementite steels, the concept of effective grain size (d EFF ) is applied to ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, DBTT, for ultrafine ferrite/cementite (Uf-F/C), ferrite/pearlite (F/P), quenched (Q), and quench-and-tempered (QT) microstructures in a low carbon steel. The d EFF  is determined to be 8, 20, 100, and 25$\mu$m for Uf-F/C, F/P, Q, and QT, respectively. In F/P and Q, it is in accordance with the ferrite grain size and the prior austenite grain size, respectively. In QT, the d EFF  fits the martensite packet size. In Uf-F/C, the ferrite grain size has a bimodal distribution and the larger grain size corresponds to the d EFF , which is the smallest among the four microstructures. In terms of the relationship between d EFF  and DBTT, the Uf-F/C, Q, and QT microstructures can be placed into the same group and the F/P to a different one. Furthermore, the Uf-F/C has the highest estimated fracture stress among the four microstructures. These might be the result of the difference in the surface energy of fracture, namely the former is estimated to have a surface energy of 34.6 J/m 2  and latter a surface energy of 7.7 J/m 2 . Thus, the excellent toughness of the ultrafine ferrite/cementite steel can be attributed to the small d EFF  and the high surface energy of fracture.},

abstract = {Room temperature tensile and compressive properties of refractory complex, concentrated alloys (RCCAs) have been analyzed to explore correlations capable of anticipating ductility in this growing class of structural materials. The Pugh-Pettifor and Rice-Thomson ductility criteria are generally satisfied by the current dataset, but the dataset does not cover a sufficiently wide range to provide a critical evaluation. A previously suggested ductility criterion based on the average valence electron concentration (VEC) of an alloy, i.e. abrupt ductile to brittle transition at VEC = 4.5, is not supported in the present study. A revised VEC criterion is suggested, but the data supporting this trend is sparse and additional work is needed. These three ductility criteria are evaluated using only single-phase RCCA data. A new ductility criterion based on the RCCA yield strength ($\sigma$y) is suggested from the present work, using both single-phase and multi-phase data. RCCAs with commercially relevant tensile ductility have $\sigma$y ≤ 1200 MPa, and alloys with compressive ductility of ≥30{\%} (analyzed here to provide useful tensile ductility) have $\sigma$y ≤ 1500 MPa. Strengthening models to predict $\sigma$y in RCCAs may thus be used to anticipate alloys that may also possess useable levels of ductility.},

At static condition, the face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the hexagonal close-packed lattice, resulting in a negative intrinsic stacking fault energy (ISF). However, the unstable stacking fault energy (USF), representing the energy barrier along the-surface connecting the ideal fcc and the intrinsic stacking fault positions, is large and positive. The ISF is calculated to have a strong positive temperature coefficient, while the USF decreases monotonously with temperature. According to the recent plasticity theory, the overall effect of temperature is to move paramagnetic fcc Fe from the stacking fault formation regime (K) towards maximum twinning (K) and finally to a dominating full-slip regime (K). Our predictions are discussed in connection with the available experimental observations.},

abstract = {Nickel-based single crystal superalloys (Ni-SXs) are of great interests in aircraft industry due to their excellent high temperature creep strength deriving from the rigid gamma/gamma prime ($\gamma$/$\gamma$′) microstructure and the single crystal nature. The creep properties of Ni-SXs depend strongly on the degradation rate of the original rigid $\gamma$/$\gamma$′ microstructure with the dislocation movements in the microstructure. Since the applied temperature and stress strongly affect the dislocation movements, the different creep mechanisms are displayed to Ni-SXs during low temperature (∼750 °C), mid-temperature (∼950 °C) and high temperature (∼1100 °C) creep. The creep deformation during low temperature creep is mainly caused by the shearing of $\gamma$′ phase by a limited number of dislocations, while high temperature creep mainly occurs to the accumulation of creep strains with the increased dislocation activities in $\gamma$ phase. To enhance the creep properties of alloy, a variety of strategies of the microstructural optimization need to be considered. One is to increase the volume fraction of $\gamma$′ phase to enhance the precipitation strengthening effects. But excessive amounts of $\gamma$′ phase are disadvantageous to low temperature strength of alloy. The coarsening of $\gamma$′ phase and the rafting process strongly correlates to dislocation movements. It is of importance to discuss the specific mechanisms of coarsening and rafting as well as their influence to the creep properties of alloy. The lattice misfit between the $\gamma$ and $\gamma$′ phase plays an important role in influencing the coarsening of $\gamma$′ phase and the creep properties of alloy. A proper lattice misfit helps to form the cubic $\gamma$′ phase which is advantageous to alloy. But a too large lattice misfit can promote the coarsening of $\gamma$′ phase that damages the structural stability of alloy at high temperatures. The increased additions of refractory elements in alloy promote the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. TCP phase facilitates the nucleation and propagation of micro-cracks around it that damages the creep properties of alloy. This review aims to summarize some aspects of microstructural evolution during creep of alloy with considering their effects to creep properties. To guide the design of Ni-SXs in future, some perspectives about the microstructural optimization are properly provided.},

abstract = {Single crystal Ni-based superalloys have long been an essential material for gas turbines in aero engines and power plants due to their outstanding high temperature creep, fatigue and oxidation resistance. A turning point was the addition of only 3 wt.{\%} Re in the second generation of single crystal Ni-based superalloys which almost doubled the creep lifetime. Despite the significance of this improvement, the mechanisms underlying the so-called “Re effect” have remained controversial. Here, we provide direct evidence of Re enrichment to crystalline defects formed during creep deformation, using combined transmission electron microscopy, atom probe tomography and phase field modelling. We reveal that Re enriches to partial dislocations and imposes a drag effect on dislocation movement, thus reducing the creep strain rate and thereby improving creep properties. These insights can guide design of better superalloys, a quest which is key to reducing CO2 emissions in air-traffic.},

abstract = {High-temperature creep equipment with very high precision has been used to measure the creep of MgO single crystals above 1948 K and stresses lower than 4 MPa. A transition in exponent, n, from 3 at stresses higher than 2 MPa to almost unity at lower stress region was observed. Since in a single crystal deformation can only occur by the generation and movement of dislocations, the transition in stress exponent from high to low stress region cannot be interpreted in terms of a change from dislocation to diffusional creep processes. Decreasing the stress by a small amount during steady-state creep resulted in an incubation period of zero creep rate before creep commenced at lower stress. However, large stress reduction led to a period of negative creep during which the dislocation substructure coarsens and the subgrain cell boundaries straighten. On the basis of dislocation substructure studies, it is proposed that the kinetics of backflow are thought to be based on the local network refinement caused by the reverse movement of dislocations and that recovery is necessary before further movement of dislocation can occur. It is shown that the network theory proposed by Davis and Wilshire can satisfactorily account for all stress reduction observed during forward creep. {\textcopyright} 1986 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

abstract = {Slip in face centred cubic (fcc) metals is well documented to occur on {\{}111{\}} planes in 〈110〉 directions. In body centred cubic (bcc) metals, the slip direction is also well established to be 〈111〉, but it is much less clear as to the slip planes on which dislocations move. Since plasticity in metals is governed by the collective motion and interaction of dislocations, the nature of the relevant slip planes is of critical importance in understanding and modelling plasticity in bcc metals. This review attempts to address two fundamental questions regarding the slip planes in bcc metals. First, on what planes can slip, and thus crystallographic rotation, be observed to occur, i.e. what are the effective slip planes? Second, on what planes do kinks form along the dislocation lines, i.e. what are the fundamental slip planes? We review the available literature on direct and indirect characterisation of slip planes from experiments, and simulations using atomistic models. Given the technological importance of bcc transition metals, this review focuses specifically on those materials. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and ASM International.},

abstract = {Transition metal elements, alloys, and intermetallic compounds often adopt the body centered cubic (bcc) and face centered cubic (fcc) structures. By comparing quantitative density functional with qualitative tight-binding calculations, we analyze the electronic factors which make the bcc and fcc structures energetically favorable. To do so, we develop a tight-binding function, $\Delta$Estar, a function that measures the energetic effects of transferring electrons within wave vector stars. This function allows one to connect distortions in solids to the Jahn-Teller effect in molecules and to provide an orbital perspective on structure determining deformations in alloys. We illustrate its use by considering first a two-dimensional square net. We then turn to three-dimensional fcc and bcc structures, and distortions of these. Using $\Delta$Estar, we rationalize the differences in energy of these structures. We are able to deduce which orbitals are responsible for instabilities in seven to nine valence electron per atom (e-/a) bcc systems and five and six e-/a fcc structures. Finally we demonstrate that these results account for the bcc and fcc type structures found in both the elements and binary intermetallic compounds of group 4 through 9 transition metal atoms. The outline of a theory of metal structure deformations based on loss of point group operation rather than translational symmetry is presented.},

Such defects can initiate twinning which strengthens mechanical properties, e.g. twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP), of high entropy alloys (HEAs) at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, by using density functional theory (DFT), the twinning initiated from stacking faults is discussed with regard to two different solute elements, Al and Mo, in the FeNiCoCr HEAs. Our results show that adding aluminum (Al) has noticeable enhancement of twinnability while molybdenum (Mo) only induces more stacking faults in the FeNiCoCr-based HEAs.},

A systematic design approach uses palettes of elements chosen to meet target properties of each HEA family and gives methods to build HEAs from these palettes.

A 3-stage approach is given to systematically screen and evaluate a vast number of HEAs by integrating high-throughput computations and experiments. CALPHAD methods are used to predict phase equilibria, and high-throughput experiments on materials libraries with controlled composition and microstructure gradients are suggested. Much of this evaluation can be done now, but key components (materials libraries with microstructure gradients and high-throughput tensile testing) are currently missing.

The idea in the efficiency improvement is to apply linear-independent coupling strains to a crystal, and to extract the complete set of elastic constants simultaneously.

The origin of Vanadium's special role is its atomic volume: large in the fcc alloys and small in the bcc alloys, and thus having a large misfit volume in both crystalline structures. A parameter-free theory applicable to both fcc and bcc HEAs rationalizes this finding, with predictions of strength across a range of fcc and bcc alloys in quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments. In the fcc class, the analysis demonstrates why the newly-discovered NiCoV and Ni0.632V0.368 alloys have far higher strength than any other fcc alloy and are predicted to be the highest attainable. In the bcc class, the analysis demonstrates that the addition of V always increases the strength relative to the same alloys without V. The optimization of complex alloys for high strength should thus center around the inclusion of V as a primary element at concentration levels of around 25 at.{\%}},

abstract = {The deformation mechanisms of Al0.3CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) is investigated through studying the serrated flow behavior under different conditions. Results show that abnormal variation trends happen in the serration curves during compression, denoting a transition of the deformation mechanism with the temperature increasing. Microstructure characterization reveals this transition is a twining to slip deformation, which is evidenced by nanoscale twins at 600 °C but high density dislocations at 800 °C. This temperature dependent deformation behavior is thought to be related with the dislocation mobility and stacking fault energy (SFE).},

abstract = {High-entropy and medium-entropy alloys are presumed to have a configurational entropy as high as that of an ideally mixed solid solution (SS) of multiple elements in near-equal proportions. However, enthalpic interactions inevitably render such chemically disordered SSs rare and metastable, except at very high temperatures. Here we highlight the wide variety of local chemical ordering (LCO) that sets these concentrated SSs apart from traditional solvent-solute ones. Using atomistic simulations, we reveal that the LCO of the multi-principal-element NiCoCr SS changes with alloy processing conditions, producing a wide range of generalized planar fault energies. We show that the LCO heightens the ruggedness of the energy landscape and raises activation barriers governing dislocation activities. This influences the selection of dislocation pathways in slip, faulting, and twinning, and increases the lattice friction to dislocation motion via a nanoscale segment detrapping mechanism. In contrast, severe plastic deformation reduces the LCO towards random SS.},

abstract = {Abstract In this study, CoCrFeMnNi (Cantor alloy) high-entropy alloy (HEA) with ultra-fine grained (UFG) structure were prepared using cryogenic (liquid nitrogen, 77 K) rolling followed by short time annealing. The deformation behavior and strain rate sensitivity (SRS) of processed material were investigated by tensile test at temperatures ranging from 77 K to 573 K. It was found that the critical twinning stress of the UFG alloy decreased at 77 K, which was attributed to the decrease of stacking fault energy with the temperature. In addition, the UFG alloy exhibited plastic instability and was prominently strengthened with increasing testing temperature from 293 K to 473 K, which was related to obviously grain boundaries relaxation in HEAs. The strain rate jump test revealed that the SRS change of UFG specimen with the decrease of grain size was inversely proportional to the associated strength enhancement, and exhibited a stronger temperature dependence than that of CG specimens especially from 293 K to 473 K. The stronger temperature dependence of SRS of UFG Cantor alloys was due to the increased grain boundary relaxation, which was a thermal activation process and depended on strain rate and temperature.},

abstract = {Impact toughness of an ultrafine-grained (UFG) interstitial-free (IF) steel produced by equalchannel angular extrusion/pressing (ECAE/P) at room temperature was investigated using Charpy impact tests. The UFG IF steel shows an improved combination of strength and impact toughness compared with the corresponding coarse-grained (CG) one. The CG IF steel samples underwent a transition in fracture toughness values with decreasing temperature because of a sudden change in fracture mode from microvoid coalescence (ductile) to cleavage (brittle) fracture. Grain refinement down to the submicron (≈320 nm) levels increased the impact energies in the upper shelf and lower shelf regions, and it considerably decreased the ductile-tobrittle transition temperature (DBTT) from 233 K (-40 °C) for the CG steel to approximately 183 K (-90 °C) for the UFG steel. Also, the sudden drop in DBTT with a small transition range for the CG sample changed to a more gradual decrease in energy for the UFG sample. The improvement in toughness after UFG formation was attributed to the combined effects of grain refinement and delamination and/or separation in the heavily deformed microstructure. Although an obvious change from the ductile fracture by dimples to the brittle fracture by cleavage was recognized at 233 K (-40 °C) for the CG steel, no fully brittle fracture occurred even at 103 K (-170 °C) in the UFG steel. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted much attention since they can possess some unique properties. By adjusting their multi-principal elements, some systems with body centered cubic (BCC) structure could obtain an excellent trade-off of strength and ductility, e.g. recently reported single-phase Hf0.5Nb0.5Ta0.5Ti1.5Zr refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA). However, researchers found that some HEAs are thermally metastable and could decompose within a certain temperature range. The thermal stability is especially important for RHEAs which are promising for high-temperature applications. Here we evaluated the phase stability of a BCC Hf0.5Nb0.5Ta0.5Ti1.5Zr RHEA after anneals for two weeks at 500–900 °C. Microstructural analyses, performed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transparent electron microscopy, show that the RHEA is a single-phase solid solution after recrystallization for 3 h at 1000 °C and remains in this state after a subsequent anneal at 900 °C for two weeks. However, it is unstable and forms second-phase precipitates at and below 800 °C. Tiny precipitates on the grain boundaries (GBs) were observed in the sample annealed at 800 °C. Annealed at 700 °C, precipitates with BCC structure (termed as BCC2) both on the GBs as chains and at intragranular regions as petaloid morphology are present. After the anneal at 500 °C, the RHEA decomposes into multi-phase microstructures with different morphologies: lamellar structure close to the GBs composed of BCC1 and BCC2 phases, and convoluted basket-like structure inside grains comprising a third hexagonal close-packed phase precipitates except for both BCC phases. Thus the phase stability of this RHEA should be carefully evaluated for elevated temperature applications.},

abstract = {Solid solutioning has long been employed to improve the performance of enegineering materials, the degree of improvement generally correlates closely with the resultant lattice parameters. It is therefore of great importance for materials design to describe accurately the composition-dependent lattice constants of the solid solutions (SSs). However, existing models could hardly reproduce the usually non-linear relationship between the compositions and the lattice constants. Herein, we present a new model within the framework of virtual crystal approximation by taking into account both the size factor and the electronic effect. The model takes inputs as simple as the fundamental property parameters of the elementary substances and N referential SSs for an N-component system, and can then predict the lattice constant of SS with any composition within the system. Systematical validation using datasets obtained from high-throughput first-principles calculations and available experiments confirmed the high reliability and general applicability of our model for various substitutional SSs. Applications and limitations of the model as well as outlooks were also discussed. It is expected that this model will deepen the understanding of the relationship between the composition and the properties of materials.},

Uniform internal H contents ranged from 0 to 50 wt ppm H (0 to 3000 at. ppm H), and a strain rate of 8.5 X 10-7 m/s was used with notched strip specimens. The three alloys showed varying losses in strength and ductility, and the strongest alloy, IN718, showed a decrease of 67 pet in ductility for a dissolved H content of 40 wt ppm. Superalloy A286 showed a corresponding 50 pet decrease in ductility, and IN625 showed a 29 pet loss in ductility.

This relationship has been codified for the design space of positive enthalpy alloys; unfortunately, quantitative values for the grain boundary segregation enthalpy exist in only very few material systems, hampering the prospect of nanocrystalline alloy design.

abstract = {The relationship between microstructure and cleavage resistance in quenched and tempered high-strength bainitic and martensitic steels is investigated by means of Charpy-V tests, uniaxial tensile test on unnotched specimens and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD). Steels under investigation are low/medium carbon (C = 0.10-0.40{\%}) steels with yield strength in the range YS = 500-1000 MPa. Results show that the tensile strength and the cleavage resistance of quenched and tempered (Q{\&}T) steels appear to be controlled by different structural parameters and not, as in the case of polygonal ferritic steels, by the same structural unit. In particular, yield strength is controlled by the mean subgrain size, whereas the structural unit controlling the critical cleavage stress is the covariant (bainitic or martensitic) packet, whose size is slightly lower than the average unit crack path (UCP). The critical stage in the fracture process appears to be the propagation of a Griffith crack from one packet to another, and the resistance offered by high-angle boundaries is approximately the same as that of low-C steels with bainitic or polygonal ferrite microstructure. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Over last 15 years high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) have gained much appreciation for their numerous superior properties. In this paper we have shown a novel simulation methodology to realistically predict the nanometer level local structural features of complex Ta0.25Nb0.25Hf0.25Zr0.25 HEA. This involves prediction of the morphology of the short-range clustering (SRCs), their quantitative atomic composition at the nano level and the thermodynamic aspects. An alloy structure model containing 11664 atoms was created and this was subjected to structure evolution at 1800 °C. The structure evolution technique is based on a combined hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) approach. The simulated results from this work are further validated against experiments and material characterizations reported in literature and done by high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM) for the nano-level microstructure, atom probe tomography (APT) for the local chemical compositions and X-ray diffraction at synchrotron sources for the local lattice relaxation effects. This work qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the materials characterization results reasonably well from the developed simulation methodologies. The structure evolution methods as described in this work are based on independent computer simulations and does not involve any manual intervention for input based on experiments on evolving SRCs. This work shows the potential of utilizing MC/MD based computational methods to reduce the number of costly experimental characterizations and accelerate the pace for materials development.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are an exciting new class of multi-component alloys some of which have unusual and remarkable properties. As of yet, little is understood about dislocation core structure and stacking fault energies in these alloys. For this study, a five-component, equiatomic alloy (CrMnFeCoNi) was deformed to 5{\%} plastic strain at room temperature. Post-test observations using diffraction contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (DC-STEM) analysis provide evidence for numerous planar slip bands composed of 1/2{\textless}110{\textgreater} dislocations. More detailed analyses of dislocation separation distances were performed using high-order diffraction vector DC-STEM and atomic resolution high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM on 1/2;{\textless}110{\textgreater} dislocations in 60°orientation. Large variations in dissociation distances are found, leading to the concept of a local stacking fault energy (SFE). This finding is supported through embedded-atom-method (EAM) calculations of a model, concentrated, three-element solid solution. For the first time, the Nye tensor and center of symmetry analysis were used collectively to accurately determine dissociation distance. Lastly, using high-resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, no ordering or segregation was observed, indicating that this alloys is a true solid solution down to the atomic scale in the recrystallized and lightly deformed state.},

The properties were correlated with the microstructure developed during compression testing. The alloy was produced by vacuum arc melting, and it was hot isostatically pressed (HIPd) and homogenized at 1473 K for 24 h prior to testing. It had a single-phase body-centered cubic structure with the lattice parameter a = 340.4 pm. The grain size was in the range of 100–200 $\mu$m. During compression at a strain rate of έ = 10−3 s−1, the alloy had the yield strength of 929 MPa at 296 K, 790 MPa at 673 K, 675 MPa at 873 K, 535 MPa at 1073 K, 295 MPa at 1273 K and 92 MPa at 1473 K. Continuous strain hardening and good ductility ($\epsilon$ ≥ 50{\%}) were observed in the temperature range from 296 to 873 K. Deformation at T = 1073 K and έ ≥ 10−3 s−1 was accompanied by intergranular cracking and cavitation, which was explained by insufficient dislocation and diffusion mobility to accommodate grain boundary sliding activated at this temperature. The intergranular cracking and cavitation disappeared with an increase in the deformation temperature to 1273 and 1473 K or a decrease in the strain rate to {\~{}}10−5 s−1. At these high temperatures and/or low-strain rates the alloy deformed homogeneously and showed steady-state flow at a nearly constant flow stress. Partial dynamic recrystallization, leading to formation of fine equiaxed grains near grain boundaries, was observed in the specimens deformed at 1073 and 1273 K and completed dynamic recrystallization was observed at 1473 K.},

A promising WReTaMo refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) with high strength at 1600 {\textordmasculine}C was fabricated by vacuum arc melting. The WReTaMo RHEA had a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure with a maximal compressive strength of 1140 MPa and Vickers microhardness of 654 HV at room temperature. The alloy displayed a strong resistance to high-temperature softening, showing the high maximal compressive strength of 244 MPa at 1600 {\textordmasculine}C. The deformation of the WReTaMo RHEA compressed at 1600 {\textordmasculine}C maybe resulted from the grain boundary sliding, which led to the propagation of the cracks along grain boundaries. Face-centered cubic (FCC) phase formed at the surface region of samples annealed above 1800 {\textordmasculine}C due to the diffusion of carbon atoms by gas carburizing in the graphite crucible at such high temperatures. The increase in hardness at temperatures above 1600 {\textordmasculine}C resulted from the solid-solution strengthening of dissolved carbon. The forming ability of the WReTaMo RHEA was also discussed. This work presents a promising high-temperature structural material and fills the vacancy of the mechanical properties of Re-containing RHEAs at 1600 {\textordmasculine}C.

abstract = {Component failures due to the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) were observed in different industrial systems, including high-pressure hydrogen storage tanks, aircraft components, high-strength alloy components, and high-strength steel fasteners. The contemporary approach in studying the effects of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of steels and iron at different scales is based on the implementation of various multiscale (macro, micro-meso, and nano-atomic) modeling approaches and the applications of advanced experimental methods. A large number of contemporary studies confirmed the multiple effects and activity of different HE mechanisms in steels and iron. The coexistence and synergistic activity – concurrent action and effects in a cooperative manner of different HE mechanisms, including the hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) and the hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE), were recently detected and confirmed through computations-simulations, as well as experimentally in different grades of steel. However, the critical evaluation and quantification of synergy between the HELP and HEDE mechanisms, enhanced plasticity and decohesion, hydrogen-deformation/dislocation interactions and their simultaneous effect on the mechanical properties (hardening and softening), still do not exist. In this review paper, the multifaceted nature of the synergistic interplay of HE mechanisms is covered through extensive literature overview regarding the chronological development of ideas related to the HELP + HEDE concept and HELP mediated HEDE model. The particular emphasis is given to the proposal of the novel and unified HELP + HEDE model based on the specific microstructural mapping of the dominant HE mechanisms with implications on the fracture process and resulting hydrogen-assisted fracture modes. Most of up-to-date experimental and modeling approaches, current trends and future challenges in the investigation of the synergistic interplay of HE mechanisms in different grades of steel, including the most advanced, and iron, are also included and critically discussed.},

abstract = {The impact of a concentrated solid solution on the deformation mechanisms of a bcc multi-principal elements alloy is investigated. The room temperature mechanical properties in tension and simple shear are studied on samples with controlled microstructure. The partition of the various stress components is performed, as well as the determination of the activation volumes and the analysis of the dislocation density and velocity. The study of the mechanical behavior is coupled to a complete TEM investigation. The alloy displays a high yield strength that is explained by a strong impact of the short-range obstacles to the dislocation glide, with an enhancement of the effective stress due to the concentrated solid solution. The increase of the backstress is related to the formation of a heterogeneous dislocation structure, with dense dislocation bands acting as long-range obstacles. Deformation is controlled by screw dislocation glide. The a/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocations are rectilinear, indicating a high lattice friction effect. Evolution of both dislocation velocity and density during multirelaxation transients suggests a low mobility. If activation volumes are consistent with a Peierls mechanism, other considerations rather head towards the hypothesis of a transitory regime where the solid solution could impact further the dislocation glide.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Low carbon MnCrMoNiCu alloyed steels are typically used to produce highly ductile thick plates for offshore structures and bulk shipbuilding. The current study revealed how microscopic factors affect the toughness and the occurrence of cleavage fracture of the steel. In this regard, a series of thermal treatments was performed on the test steel by employing a thermomechanical simulator. These involved reheating samples at different temperatures (1168 K to 1623 K (895 °C to 1350 °C))  producing different prior austenite grain sizes, followed by a continuous cooling transformation process. The Charpy V notch (CVN) toughness was determined, and the effect of the austenite grain size on the ductile-brittle transition-temperatures of the steel was investigated. The microstructural evolution of the austenite grain sizes was studied, fracture features were characterized, the critical event for cleavage fracture was identified, and the local cleavage fracture stress $\sigma$f was calculated. The CVN toughness and $\sigma$f were maximized in the steel which was reheated at 1273 K (1000 °C) and containing refined lathlike bainite. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Mechanical responses of tungsten (W) and its alloys are strongly controlled by the properties of 1/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocations. Rhenium (Re), as a typical alloying and transmutation element in W, can substantially modify the properties of the dislocations, thus the plasticity of the materials. In this study, we investigate the interaction of Re and Re clusters with the screw dislocations in W by first-principles calculations in combination with theoretical models. Specifically, we propose two competing and Re-distribution dependent mechanisms, i.e. “ductilizing effect” and “hardening effect”; both are crucial to the mechanical properties of W. For the ductilizing effect, dispersed Re atoms weaken the surrounding interatomic interaction and reduce the shear resistance, thus facilitating the motion of the dislocation. In contrast, for the hardening effect, Re clusters formed by aggregated Re atoms due to irradiation can increase the Peierls stress and energy, thus hindering the motion of the dislocations. The proposed mechanisms shed light on the experimental observations that there is a Re-induced transition from ductilizing to hardening due to irradiation. The current work provides a theoretical guidance to the development of W-based future fusion materials in search of ductilizing alloying elements.},

By subtracting all possible strengthening contributions, the intrinsic strength (or lattice friction stress) of each alloy was extracted. It was found that lattice friction stress scaled linearly with the lattice distortion in these Nb-based alloys. A simple model was developed to interpret this result. Strengthening effects of lattice distortion and dislocation core width between bcc Nb-based and face-centered-cubic (fcc) Ni-based equiatomic alloys were also compared. It was demonstrated that the enhanced strength in high-entropy alloys was attributable to the lattice distortion.

We demonstrate how this picture can be combined with a computational thermodynamic model of phase stability, based on high-throughput ab initio calculations, to further narrow down the search and deliver alloys that maintain rhenium's desirable hcp crystal structure. This thermodynamic model is validated with comparisons to known binary phase diagram sections and corroborated by experimental synthesis and structural characterization demonstrating multiprinciple-element hcp solid-solution samples selected from a promising composition range.},

Using in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and in-vacuum X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we verify the oxide growth kinetics and the final stoichiometry after each exposure condition for the four metals, and explore the particularities present in each oxide growth mechanics. The temperature-dependent analysis enabled to experimentally obtain the dissociation energy of molecular oxygen at polycrystalline O covered surfaces. By applying the principles of coupled currents and the Cabrera-Mott oxide growth mechanism, we extract values of the energy barrier for oxidation and the field formed in both oxygen molecule-metal and atom-metal interaction, exploring the differences between both exposure conditions. We demonstrate that in oxide growth at low temperatures two key points should be highlighted: (i) the strong dependence of surface potential on reactive oxygen coverage; (ii) the interrelation between exposure conditions and crystalline oxide formation. The obtained results and analysis contribute to the understanding of oxidation processes at low temperatures, advancing the knowledge required for the design and synthesis of thin metal and oxide films.},

abstract = {A current goal driving alloy development is the identification of alloy compositions for high temperature applications but with the additional requirement of sufficient ductility at ambient temperatures. Multicomponent, single-phase, polycrystalline High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) have recently emerged as a new class of metal alloys, and some refractory bcc HEAs composed mainly of Nb, V, Ta, Cr, Mo, and/or W show excellent strength retention up to very high temperatures but low ductility at room temperature (RT). Here, it is postulated that the macroscopic ductility in bcc elements and alloys is determined by the intrinsic competition between brittle cleavage and ductile dislocation emission mechanisms at an atomistically sharp crack. The stress intensities KIc for cleavage and KIe for emission are evaluated within Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics and validated by atomistic simulations on model alloys. A RT ductility criterion based on KIe∕KIc for critical crack orientations is proposed based on the elemental metals and is then applied to HEAs. Agreement with experimental trends in ductility vs. composition across a range of existing HEAs is demonstrated. The analysis is then extended across large composition spaces of the Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W and Mo-Nb-Ti alloy families, identifying new compositions with the potential for RT ductility.},

abstract = {Short-range order (SRO) strengthening is one of the major strengthening mechanisms in alloys. Generally it is attributed to the increased resistance to dislocation slip caused by breaking favorable bonds. This contribution may be strong for the first dislocation slipping in a slip plane, but it is certainly less strong for the following next dislocations. Present work discusses SRO strengthening with a different optic: with the focus on the dissipated energy due to the formation of a diffuse antiphase boundary (APB). In this sense, SRO strengthening becomes important to define the friction stress on gliding dislocations. Cluster Variation Method calculations of APB energies are used to estimate the strengthening effect in BCC alloys. The results are illustrated using VNbTaMoW and VNbTaWAl high-entropy alloys, with ab-initio derived parameters. The results show that the strengthening is intense in the range of concentrated solid solutions, and also, that this effect is strongly composition-dependent.},

With the aid of ball milling, the stabilized single-phase BCC nano-crystalline structures can be obtained with the average crystallite size of about 10 nm. After the SPS process, the grain size of both alloys is less than 1 µm. The compressive yield strength, fracture strain and Vickers hardness of bulk Nb25Mo25Ta25W25 HEA are 2460 MPa, 16.8{\%} and 7.78 GPa, respectively, which are remarkably superior to the same alloy prepared by the vacuum arc-melting (VAM) method. The addition of Ti can further promote the compressive properties in the Ti8Nb23Mo23Ta23W23 HEA, where the fracture strain and peak compressive stress surprisingly increased by 56.5{\%} and 10.7{\%}, respectively.},

ZrTiNbMo alloy has a body-centered cubic (BCC) single phase structure, and the Cr addition leads to the formation of Laves phase. The HEAs can be strengthened by Cr addition due to more formation of Laves phase and solution strengthening. Zr20Ti20Nb20Mo20Cr20 HEA shows the maximum Vickers hardness of 564 HV and maximum compressive yield strength of 1479 MPa, respectively. In contrary, the ductility can be retained when x = 2, but obviously decreases with further increasing Cr content. Thermal stability and hydrogen desorption capacity of the hydrogenated HEAs decreases with Cr addition, which may be mainly ascribed to the reduction of cell volume and much less stability of hydrogen atoms in solid solution with increasing Cr content.},

abstract = {Point defects and impurities strongly affect the physical properties of materials and have a decisive impact on their performance in applications. First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiments and can serve as a predictive tool in the identification and characterization of defects. The theoretical modeling of point defects in crystalline materials by means of electronic-structure calculations, with an emphasis on approaches based on density functional theory (DFT), is reviewed. A general thermodynamic formalism is laid down to investigate the physical properties of point defects independent of the materials class (semiconductors, insulators, and metals), indicating how the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as formation energy, entropy, and excess volume, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations. Practical aspects such as the supercell approach and efficient strategies to extrapolate to the isolated-defect or dilute limit are discussed. Recent advances in tractable approximations to the exchange-correlation functional (DFT+U, hybrid functionals) and approaches beyond DFT are highlighted. These advances have largely removed the long-standing uncertainty of defect formation energies in semiconductors and insulators due to the failure of standard DFT to reproduce band gaps. Two case studies illustrate how such calculations provide new insight into the physics and role of point defects in real materials. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this work, the synergistic effect of Re and W on the evolution of the topological close-packed phases (TCP) in Nickel-based superalloys were studied by means of Thermo-Calculation (TC), solidifying slowly, Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), and solution-aging treatment. The specimens were analyzed by means of SEM-EDS, TEM-SADP, and EPMA. The calculated results indicated that the P phase precipitated prior to the $\mu$ phase with the temperature decrease, and both phases $\mu$ and P coexisted in a certain temperature range when the content of Re was higher ( Re: 5–7 wt{\%}) and the content of W was lower ( W:4–6 wt{\%}); Only phase $\mu$ precipitated from the alloy when Re content was less than 4 wt{\%} and W content was higher than 7 wt{\%}. The experimental results showed that the $\mu$ phases were slats-like and distributed in parallel in different orientations; and the $\mu$/P intergrowth phases with coherent relationship were short rod-like. In addition, the gathered $\mu$/P intergrowth phases around the big blocky-like $\gamma$' phases were found in alloys solidified slowly, which was prone to cause holes. Based on phase-transition temperature obtained by combining calculation and DTA, the solution-aging process of the alloys were determined. After solution-aging treatment, the long strip shape $\mu$ phases and short rod-like $\mu$/P intergrowth phases distributed uniformly in the matrix, and the big blocky-like $\gamma$' phases and holes disappeared. The experimental results showed that the total amount of TCP phase decreased and the P phase gradually disappeared when the content of Re decreased and the content of W increased. The research results had a guiding role in optimizing the composition of alloys and predicting the safety performance of aerocraft during the flight cycle.},

abstract = {High entropy alloys contain multiple elements in large proportions that make them prone to phase separation. These alloys generally have shallow enthalpy of mixing which makes the entropy contributions of similar magnitude. As a result, the phase stability of these alloys is equally dependent on enthalpy and entropy of mixing and understanding the individual contribution of thermodynamic properties is critical. In the overall vision of designing high entropy alloys, in this work, using density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the contributions of various entropies, i.e., vibrational, electronic and configurational towards the phase stability of binary alloys. We show that the contribution of electronic entropy is very small compared to the vibrational and configurational entropies, and does not play a significant role in the phase stability of alloys. The configurational and vibrational entropies can either destabilize or can collectively contribute to stabilize the solid solutions. As a result, even those systems that have negative mixing enthalpy can show phase instability, revealed as a miscibility gap; conversely, systems with positive mixing enthalpy can be phase stable due to entropic contributions. We suggest that including entropic contributions are critical in the development of theoretical framework for the computational prediction of stable, single-phase high entropy alloys that have shallow mixing enthalpies, unlike ordered intermetallics.},

@article{Turnbull1992,
abstract = {The electrochemical permeation technique has been used to characterize hydrogen transport and trapping in pure nickel and in alloys 600, X-750, and 718 at a temperature of 80 °C. The "effective diffusivity" of hydrogen atoms in alloy 600 is reduced by a factor of about 5 compared to pure nickel. This is attributed to both compositional changes and the presence of [(Ti, Nb)C] carbides. Aging of alloy 600, with subsequent M23C6 carbide precipitation, does not significantly influence the measured "effective diffusivity," which is explained by the dominant effect of preexisting [(Ti, Nb)C] carbides. The "effective diffusivity" of hydrogen atoms in solution-annealed alloy X-750 is reduced by a factor of about 9 compared to that of pure nickel. This is also attributed to compositional changes and [(Ti,Nb)C] carbides. Aging of alloy X-750, which causes precipitation of $\gamma$'[Ni3(Al, Ti)], reduces the "effective diffusivity" by an additional factor of 5 or more. Double aging at 885 °C/24 hours, 704 °C/20 hours following hot working yields the greatest reduction in "effective diffusivity." Analysis of permeation transients using a diffusiontrapping model indicates a binding energy associated with trapping due to the $\gamma$' phase of between-31 and -37 kJ/mol. The "effective diffusivity" of hydrogen in alloy 718 is about 40 pct greater than for alloy X-750 for the same double and direct aging treatments. The average "effective diffusivities" of the double-aged and direct-aged alloy 718 are comparable, but the permeation transients for the double-aged treatment are significantly steeper. The double-aged treatment with predominantly S phase (orthorhombic Ni3Nb) yields a binding energy of about-30 kJ/mol. Analysis of the direct aged-treated 718, which contains predominantly $\gamma$′ phase (body-centered tetragonal Ni3Nb) gave a binding energy between -23 and -27 kJ/mol. Segregation of hydrogen atoms to the $\gamma$′/matrix interface, combined with a large volume fraction of$\gamma$ at grain boundaries, provides the most likely explanation for the enhanced cracking associated with the double-aging treatment in alloy X-750. {\textcopyright} 1992 dt]Transport Phenomena.},

Microstructure and microtexture evolution during SPS and annealing have been investigated. SPS consolidated sample exhibited heterogeneous microstructure with ultra-fine grains surrounded by coarse grains. Inhomogeneous distribution of plastic deformation induced during ball milling resulted in heterogeneous nucleation and further grain growth during consolidation. The bimodal microstructure is advantageous with coarse grains providing ductility and fine grains providing strength by the Hall–Petch relationship. The bimodal grains structure was also retained during annealing. As-sintered specimen showed 〈100〉 texture parallel to the compression axis due to dynamic recrystallization during the SPS process. At 650 °C, annealed sample exhibited 〈111〉 annealing texture parallel to compression axis. The texture was randomized in sample annealed at 1050 °C. Precipitation analysis by SEM, XRD and TEM showed the presence of M23C6, M6C and Al2O3 in both As-sintered and annealed samples. Dispersoids analysis showed the presence of fine and uniform Y3Al5O12, Y4Al2O9 and a complex oxide rich in Ni, Y, Al and O.

Therefore, a high-throughput first-principles study of Mo-V-Nb-Ti-Zr, a refractory MPEA, was conducted to gain insights into the underlying microstructures. Using Monte-Carlo simulations powered by cluster expansion, we uncover the principles governing the MPEA's microstructures across a large compositional space that includes non-equiatomic compositions and encompasses the constituent binaries, ternaries, and quaternaries. In the spirit of Hume-Rothery rules for complete solid solubility, we present a quantitative expression for predicting solid solution formation from the composition. Within a consistent framework, our results reproduce the microstructural observations (solid solution vs. segregation) from numerous experiments and provide microstructural predictions for unexplored regions in the compositional space. Our work illuminates the MPEA's microstructures in terms of the separation and clustering tendencies of the elements, presenting a set of simple but powerful design principles for future experiments to rationally design MPEAs with the desired microstructures for superior mechanical properties.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs), as a new class of materials, are nearly equiatomic and multi-element systems, which can crystallize as a single phase or multi-phases. Most of the HEAs described in the literature contain multiple phases (secondary phases, nanoparticles, and so on), rather than a single solid-solution phase. Thus, it is essential to review the typical mechanical properties of both single-phase and multiphase HEAs thoroughly, with emphases on (1) the fundamental physical mechanisms and (2) the difference from conventional alloys. In this paper, mainly based on different mechanical properties, HEAs are classified into four types for the first time, i.e., (a) HEA alloy systems of 3d-transition metals only (Type 1), (b) HEA alloy systems of transition metals with larger atomic-radius elements (Type 2), (c) HEA alloy systems of refractory metals (Type 3), and (4) others (Type 4). Then a number of aspects of mechanical behavior are reviewed and discussed, including the elastic anisotropy, yield strength, high-temperature performance, serration behavior, fracture toughness, and fatigue responses, which may serve as a demonstrative summary for the current progress in the scientific research of HEAs. Several mechanisms that quantitatively explain the mechanical properties of single-phase and multiphase HEAs in terms of basic defects (dislocations, twinning, precipitates, etc.) are discussed. A number of future research activities are suggested, based on the emphasis on developing high-performance structural materials. The review concludes with a brief summary of major mechanical properties and insights into the deformation behavior of single-phase and multiphase HEAs. The comparison and contrast between HEAs and conventional alloys remain the most compelling motivation for future studies. With the integrated experimental and simulation investigations, a clearer picture of the fundamental deformation behavior of single-phase and multiphase HEAs could be explored.},

abstract = {A material is modeled as an array of a variety of coupled elements of varied strength, each of which is characterized by a slip probability that is a function of local stress and temperature. A stochastic cellular automaton is used to run simulations of nominally constant structure creep where simple rules are used to ensure rough compliance with mechanical equilibrium and compatibility. Three cases are studied that incorporate distinctly different statistical and spatial strength distributions. For all three simulation conditions, a general form of creep curve is obtained. The general form, when plotted as log(strain) vs. log(time), has a slope near unity at short and long times which are connected by a region of minimum slope. The slope of the central region increases systematically with increasing temperature. These features are consistent with several experimental observations. The same simulation can also provide reasonable predictions of anelastic backflow. This analysis can be of value in interpreting experimental observations in both forward and reverse creep transients. {\textcopyright} 2001 Acta Materialia Inc.},

The discovery of the $\gamma$′-Co3(Al,W) phase with an L12 structure provided Co-base alloys with a new strengthening mechanism, enabling a new class of high-temperature material: Co-base superalloys. This review discusses the current understanding of the phase stability, deformation, and oxidation behaviors of $\gamma$′ single-phase and $\gamma$ +$\gamma$′ two-phase alloys in comparison with Ni-base $\gamma$′-L12 phase and $\gamma$ +$\gamma$′ superalloys. Relatively low stacking fault energies and phase stability of the $\gamma$′ phase compared with those in Ni-base alloys are responsible for the unique deformation behaviors observed in Co-base $\gamma$′ and $\gamma$ +$\gamma$′ alloys. Controlling energies of planar defects, such as stacking faults and antiphase boundaries, by alloying is critical for alloy development. Experimental and density functional theory studies indicate that additions of Ta, Ti, Nb, Hf, and Ni are effective in simultaneously increasing the phase stability and stacking fault energy of $\gamma$′-Co3(Al,W), thus improving the high-temperature strength of Co-base $\gamma$′ phase and $\gamma$ +$\gamma$′ two-phase superalloys.},

abstract = {The analysis of creep transients associated with stress change tests is reviewed, with an emphasis on using the results of these experiments to characterize the kinetics of deformation under conditions of nominally constant structure. In order to develop a common framework for the description of results obtained by various authors, operational definitions of the characteristic strain rates observed after stress changes are adopted. The data for aluminum reported by numerous investigators provide a consistent picture over a broad range of temperatures and initial creep stresses. These results show that transient creep after stress reductions occurs by two parallel processes of dislocation glide within subgrain interiors and dynamic recovery associated with subgrain boundary migration. Following relatively large stress reductions, the creep transient is dominated by the subgrain boundary migration processes. After relatively small changes in stress, thermally activated motion of dislocations within subgrain interiors is the predominant mechanism of deformation. In this regime, the creep transients can be described by a thermally activated rate law, thereby enabling various activation parameters to be evaluated from the data. In particular, the true activation areas are found to be equal to the dislocation spacing within subgrain interiors, hence are consistent with thermally activated cutting of forest dislocations. Limited results for other f.c.c. metals and related materials are shown to follow the trends established for aluminum. In particular. it is demonstrated that the data for pure copper and LiF at high temperatures and after small stress changes are also consistent with a description based on thermally activated glide. However, the true activation areas in copper are about five times greater than the dislocation spacing. This difference between copper and aluminum is attributed to the fact that the former has a substantially lower stacking fault energy. It is argued that the resulting wider separation of partials makes the thermally activated cutting of forest dislocations more difficult. {\textcopyright} 1995 Acta Metallurgica Inc.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEA), a new class of engineering alloy, are characterized by high concentrations of multiple main elements. These alloys have revealed a vast and largely unexplored compositional space that gives substantial promise for the discovery of new and interesting alloys and properties. The majority of the current computational literature focuses on phase and stability predictions for rapid exploration of this compositional space, while most of the experimental literature focuses on structural analysis and basic mechanical properties of a few well studied alloy systems. These distinct focal points leave an opportunity to explore the production of property databases for high-entropy alloys. This work attempts to bridge the computational and experimental approaches by developing a method of calculating material properties from first-principles.Stacking fault energy (SFE) is investigated in the present work due to its use in modeling mechanical and deformation behavior, such as nano-twinning. Body centered cubic refractory high-entropy alloys are selected for their promising high temperature properties and minimal exploration in the current literature. Density functional theory (DFT) and special quasi-random structures (SQS) are used to calculate the SFE of these alloys. The results are then used to analyze the usefulness of these calculation methods in producing high-throughput databases for down-selection and development of these alloys. Additionally, several methods of increasing the speed and fidelity of these property databases are introduced and investigated, including: (i) a lower order averaging method for reducing the number of required calculations, and (ii) an inferential statistics method for predicting error bars on data sets.The possible stacking faults (SF) of the BCC {\{}112{\}} plane are reviewed and classified with a new naming convention of TSn, twinning sense, and NTSn, non-twinning sense. From this new classification and a theoretical analysis, five SF are identified and investigated throughout. These SF of interest are NTS, T, TS1, TS2, and TS3. The SFE for each fault are calculated for several elements and compared to computational and experimental literature. The calculated values for the NTS fault exhibit the same trends found in the reported values from a previous computational study. Mo and W have the highest stacking fault energies while Nb and V have the lowest. The calculated value of 24 mJ/m2 for the TS1 fault in W is compared to an experimental value of 14.5 mJ/m2 in impure tungsten.The AlNbTaTiV HEA with a single solid solution BCC phase is selected for testing of the newly developed calculation method. The use of SQS for SFE calculations is analyzed and it is determined that permutation averaging is required for calculations with HEAs. Ternary lower order averaging of a quinary HEA is shown to give good results for ground-state energy calculations, but poor results for SFE calculations.Quinary calculations show excellent results for HEA SFE calculations with ranges and ratios comparable to the verified single element SFE values. Inferential statistics and sampling are introduced to deal with the large number of possible permutations, 120 for a quinary. Inferential statistics allows the properties of the total population to be predicted from a sample set of calculations. The results indicate that a sample of only 20 values are required for precise calculations. Inferential statistics are then used to place predictive error bars on the HEA SFE calculations and sampling procedure. All sample SFE values were well within the predictive error bars when compared to the SFE calculated from the total population.},

The generalized-stacking-fault (GSF) energy surface entering the model is calculated by using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and the embedded-atom method (EAM). Various core properties, including the core width, dissociation behavior, energetics, and Peierls stress for different dislocations have been investigated. The correlation between the core energetics and the Peierls stress with the dislocation character has been explored. Our results reveal a simple relationship between the Peierls stress and the ratio between the core width and the atomic spacing. The dependence of the core properties on the two methods for calculating the GSF energy (DFT vs EAM) has been examined. Although the EAM gives the general trend for various dislocation properties, it fails to predict the correct finer core structure, which in turn can affect the Peierls stress significantly (about one order of magnitude). {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

Recently, Bakushinsky and Smirnova [Iterative regularization and generalized discrepancy principle for monotone operator equations, Numer. Funct. Anal. Optim. 28 (2007) 13-25] considered an a posteriori strategy to find a stopping index k$\delta$ corresponding to inexact data y$\delta$ with ||y-$\delta$ ||≥$\delta$resulting in the convergence of the method as 0. However, they provided no error estimates. We consider an alternate strategy to find a stopping index which not only leads to the convergence of the method, but also provides an order optimal error estimate under a general source condition. Moreover, the condition that we impose on ($\alpha$k) is weaker than that considered by Bakushinsky and Smirnova. {\textcopyright} 2010 Australian Mathematical Society.},

abstract = {The nickel-base superalloy 718 is a precipitation hardened alloy widely used in the nuclear fuel assembly of pressurized water reactors (PWR). However, the alloy can experience failure due to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The processing route can influence the microstructure of the material and, therefore, the HE degree. In particular, the size and distribution of the (Nb,Ti)C particles can be affected by the processing. In this regard, the objective of this work was to analyze the influence of cold and hot deformation processing routes on the development of the microstructure, and the consequences on mechanical properties and hydrogen embrittlement. Tensile samples were hydrogenated through gaseous charging and compared to non-hydrogenated samples. Characterization was performed via scanning and transmission electron microscopies, as well as electron backscattered diffraction. The processing was effective to promote significant variations in average grain size and length fraction of special $\Sigma$3n boundaries, as well as reduction of average (Nb,Ti)C particle size, being these changes more intense for the cold-rolled route. For the mechanical properties, on one side, the cold-rolled route presented the highest increase in ductility for non-hydrogenated samples, while, on the other side, had the highest degree of embrittlement under hydrogen. This dual behavior was attributed to the interaction of hydrogen with the (Nb,Ti)C particles and stringers and its ensuing influence on the fracture processes.},

abstract = {Molecular statics and molecular dynamics simulations are presented for the structure and glide motion of a/2〈111〉 dislocations in a randomly-distributed model-BCC Co16.67Fe36.67Ni16.67Ti30 alloy. Core structure variations along an individual dislocation line are found for a/2〈111〉 screw and edge dislocations. One reason for the core structure variations is the local variation in composition along the dislocation line. Calculated unstable stacking fault energies on the (110) plane as a function of composition vary significantly, consistent with this assessment. Molecular dynamics simulations of the critical glide stress as a function of temperature show significant strengthening, and much shallower temperature dependence of the strengthening, as compared to pure BCC Fe as well as a reference mean-field BCC alloy material of the same overall composition, lattice and elastic constants as the target alloy. Interpretation of the strength versus temperature in terms of an effective kink-pair activation model shows the random alloy to have a much larger activation energy than the mean-field alloy or BCC Fe. This is interpreted as due to the core structure variations along the dislocation line that are often unfavorable for glide in the direction of the load. The configuration of the gliding dislocation is wavy, and significant debris is left behind, demonstrating the role of local composition and core structure in creating kink pinning (super jogs) and/or deflection of the glide plane of the dislocation.},

abstract = {Phase composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of six complex concentrated alloys, NbTiZr, NbTiZrV, NbTiZrVMo, NbTiZrVTa, NbTiZrVCr, and NbTiZrVAl0.24, are reported. The alloy density was in the range from 6.34 g/cm3to 8.43 g/cm3. After homogenization annealing at 1400 °C or 1200 °C, only the ternary NbTiZr alloy had a single-phase BCC crystal structure. NbTiZrV and NbTiZrVTa produced predominantly single-phase BCC structure with clusters of fine V-rich precipitates inside NbTiZrV grains and fine, Zr-rich grain boundary precipitates in NbTiZrVTa. The other three alloys contained BCC and Laves phases, and NbTiZrVMo also contained a second BCC phase. After compression deformation at 1000 °C, noticeable changes in the phase composition were found in NbTiZrV, NbTiZrVTa and NbTiZrVAl0.24, while the phase composition of other alloys retained unchanged. NbTiZr, NbTiZrV and NbTiZrVTa showed good ductility and noticeable work hardening rate at room temperature, while the ductility of other alloys rapidly decreased with increasing the amount of Laves phase. The RT yield stress varied from 975 MPa for NbTiZ to 1510 MPa for NbTiZrVMo. At 1000 °C, all the alloys showed excellent compression ductility; however only NbTiZrVCr and NbTiZrVMo were stronger than NbTiZr. The results indicate that increasing the composition complexity of refractory near-equiatomic alloys by increasing the number of the alloying elements does not necessary result in a simpler phase structure and/or better mechanical properties. The type of the alloying elements seems to be more important than their number. Additions of V, Al or Ta decrease while additions of Cr or Mo increase the 1000 °C strength of NbTiZr.},

When considering only 50 elements for compositional blending the number of possible alloys is practically infinite, as is the associated unexplored property realm. In this paper, we present a simple property-targeted quantitative design approach for atomic-level complexity in complex concentrated and high-entropy alloys, based on quantum-mechanically derived atomic-level pressure approximation. It allows identification of the best suited element mix for high solid-solution strengthening using the simple electronegativity difference among the constituent elements. This approach can be used for designing alloys with customized properties, such as a simple binary NiV solid solution whose yield strength exceeds that of the Cantor high-entropy alloy by nearly a factor of two. This study provides general design rules that enable effective utilization of atomic level information to reduce the immense degrees of freedom in compositional space without sacrificing physics-related plausibility.},

A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is shown that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals unity (just as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals two). The equations of motion obtained for relativistic spinning particle in external gravitational field differ essentially from the Papapetrou equations.},

Both superlattice intrinsic and extrinsic stacking faults (SISF and SESF) were observed in the $\gamma$′ precipitates, and the interactions of such faults had different configurations. Both V- and T-like configurations can be composed of SISF-SISF, SISF-SESF and SESF-SESF interactions, while the X-like configuration was only observed to be composed by SISF-SISF interaction. The strengthening effect and mechanism of such SF interactions on the creep resistance are discussed based on their density and formation mechanism. W elemental segregation was present along the SISFs and SESFs. In contrast, only the $\gamma$ forming element Co was enriched near the leading partial dislocations (LPDs) of the SISFs/SESFs, stair-rod dislocations and APBs. The rate limiting step of the expansion of the SFs was estimated to be the drag effect induced by the Co diffusion. In addition, the local phase transformation from the L12 to A1 structure at the intersection of SFs was mainly attributed to the Co supersaturation and aided by wetting phenomenon from the APB.},

abstract = {Microstructure, phase composition and mechanical properties of a refractory high entropy superalloy, AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr, are reported in this work. The alloy consists of a nano-scale mixture of two phases produced by the decomposition from a high temperature body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. The first phase is present in the form of cuboidal-shaped nano-precipitates aligned in rows along {\textless}100{\textgreater}-type directions, has a disordered BCC crystal structure with the lattice parameter a1 = 326.9  0.5 pm and is rich in Mo, Nb and Ta. The second phase is present in the form of channels between the cuboidal nano-precipitates, has an ordered B2 crystal structure with the lattice parameter a2 = 330.4  0.5 pm and is rich in Al, Ti and Zr. Both phases are coherent and have the same crystallographic orientation within the former grains. The formation of this modulated nano-phase structure is discussed in the framework of nucleation-and-growth and spinodal decomposition mechanisms. The yield strength of this refractory high entropy superalloy is superior to the yield strength of Ni-based superalloys in the temperature range of 20 C to 1200 C.},

With the same H concentration, hydrogen-enhanced vacancies can more easily form at a low temperature than a high temperature.

abstract = {Room temperature tensile and compressive properties of refractory complex, concentrated alloys (RCCAs) have been analyzed to explore correlations capable of anticipating ductility in this growing class of structural materials. The Pugh-Pettifor and Rice-Thomson ductility criteria are generally satisfied by the current dataset, but the dataset does not cover a sufficiently wide range to provide a critical evaluation. A previously suggested ductility criterion based on the average valence electron concentration (VEC) of an alloy, i.e. abrupt ductile to brittle transition at VEC = 4.5, is not supported in the present study. A revised VEC criterion is suggested, but the data supporting this trend is sparse and additional work is needed. These three ductility criteria are evaluated using only single-phase RCCA data. A new ductility criterion based on the RCCA yield strength ($\sigma$y) is suggested from the present work, using both single-phase and multi-phase data. RCCAs with commercially relevant tensile ductility have $\sigma$y ≤ 1200 MPa, and alloys with compressive ductility of ≥30{\%} (analyzed here to provide useful tensile ductility) have $\sigma$y ≤ 1500 MPa. Strengthening models to predict $\sigma$y in RCCAs may thus be used to anticipate alloys that may also possess useable levels of ductility.},

abstract = {A simple model of a disordered substitutional alloy, similar in some respects to transition-metal alloys, is studied in several approximations. A formalism is presented in which the Green's function for the alloy is represented in the form of an infinite perturbation series, the lowest term of which is the coherent-potential approximation introduced earlier. The average density of states for several model alloys is investigated, and it is found that corrections to the rigid-band model can be significant even in situations in which the constitutents are not very dissimilar. Study of certain terms in the perturbation series suggests that the coherent-potential approximation is adequate in many situations. The density of states localized about a particular type of atom is shown to bear little resemblance to the average density of states. It can be a strong function of the environment, but if an average environment is taken, the coherent-potential scheme gives good results. The variation of average and local state densities as a function of concentration is studied for a particular model. {\textcopyright} 1969 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Face-centered cubic (fcc)-phase high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted much academic interest, with the stacking fault energy (SFE) playing an important role in regulating their mechanical behaviors. Here, we revealed the principles for regulating both the elastic and plastic behaviors by composition modification and Mo addition in an fcc-phase quaternary CoCrFeNi system with the assistance of ab initio and thermodynamics calculations. An increase in Co content and a decrease in Fe and Ni contents reduced the fcc phase stability and SFE, but enhanced the elastic modulus, anisotropy, and lattice friction stress. A minor substitution of Co by Mo increased the lattice constant, but decreased the SFE and elastic modulus. Based on these findings, we developed a series of strong and ductile metastable fcc-phase CoxCr25(FeNi)70-xMo5 (x = 30, 40, 50) HEAs with mechanical properties superior to those of the CoCrFeNi HEAs. The careful investigation revealed that the enhanced mechanical properties are due to the Mo-addition-induced strengthening accompanied with a low-SFE-induced restriction of planar behavior of dislocations, mechanical twinning, and strain-induced martensitic transformation. The findings shed light on the development of high-performance HEAs.},

abstract = {The anelastic contribution to creep transients in pure f.c.c. metals has been studied by conducting experiments in which nearly the entire applied stress is removed. The observed anelastic strains range from as little as one quarter of the calculated elastic contraction for Pb to 7 or 8 times the elastic contraction for pure Al. The recoverable strains in Cu are generally about equal to the elastic strains. For Al, the magnitude of the recoverable strain increases with prior creep strain. Both the magnitude and kinetics of backflow are similar for polycrystalline and single crystal specimens. Consideration of the kinetics of backflow suggests that there are at least two rate controlling mechanisms which operate during this process. An attempt has been made to determine the physical mechanisms which contribute to creep anelasticity. Based on a qualitative consideration of the kinetics and magnitude of the anelastic transients, the most likely mechanism involves motion of dislocations from subgrain interiors to the subgrain walls and is driven by long range internal back stresses. Other simple mechanisms cannot account for the large recoverable strains, although they may make additional contributions to the overall transient. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report the calculated phase diagrams of V-Nb, V-Ta, and Nb-Ta alloys computed by combining the total energies of 40-50 configurations for each system (obtained using density functional theory) with the cluster expansion and Monte Carlo techniques. For V-Nb alloys, the phase diagram computed with conventional cluster expansion shows a miscibility gap with consolute temperature T c=1250 K. Including the constituent strain to the cluster expansion Hamiltonian does not alter the consolute temperature significantly, although it appears to influence the solubility of V- and Nb-rich alloys. The phonon contribution to the free energy lowers T c to 950 K (about 25{\%}). Our calculations thus predicts an appreciable miscibility gap for V-Nb alloys. For bcc V-Ta alloy, this calculation predicts a miscibility gap with T c=1100 K. For this alloy, both the constituent strain and phonon contributions are found to be significant. The constituent strain increases the miscibility gap while the phonon entropy counteracts the effect of the constituent strain. In V-Ta alloys, an ordering transition occurs at 1583 K from bcc solid solution phase to the V 2Ta Laves phase due to the dominant chemical interaction associated with the relatively large electronegativity difference. Since the current cluster expansion ignores the V 2Ta phase, the associated chemical interaction appears to manifest in making the solid solution phase remain stable down to 1100 K. For the size-matched Nb-Ta alloys, our calculation predicts complete miscibility in agreement with experiment. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {FeCoCrNiCu high entropy alloy (HEA) powder was produced by mechanical alloying. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) were mixed in the HEA powder (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 wt.{\%} of CNT) and then the mixture was consolidated by spark plasma sintering at 800°C. Phase constitution of the pellets was sensitive to the CNT amount. With smaller quantities of CNTs (upto 2 wt.{\%}), the pellets contained a mixture of two different face centred cubic (fcc) phases along with $\sigma$ phase. With increase in the CNT amount (till 2 wt.{\%}), a gradual decrease in the volume fraction of one of the fcc phase occurred leading to microstructural homogenization. Higher CNT additions (3, 5 and 7 wt.{\%}) led to re-evolution of inhomogeneous microstructure containing chromium carbide phase and the two different fcc phases. Corrosion behaviour measurements showed that with continued addition of CNTs, reduction in the corrosion rate happened till 2wt.{\%} CNT. Beyond this, a significant enhancement in the corrosion rate was noticed for pellets with 3, 5 and 7 wt.{\%} CNT additions. Between the pristine HEA pellet and the pellet with optimum CNT amount (2 wt.{\%}), 88.6 {\%} reduction in the corrosion rate was measured. The enhancement in the corrosion resistance was attributed to an increase in the chemical homogeneity, which reduced the possibility of galvanic coupling. The decrease in the corrosion resistance beyond the optimum CNT (2 wt.{\%}) was attributed to the re-appearance of chemical heterogeneity and evolution of chromium carbide (Cr23C6) phase, which causes intergranular corrosion in these systems.},

abstract = {Though Alloy 718 is strengthened by $\gamma$′ precipitation, the nucleation of $\delta$ phase is used to stabilize grain size and also to improve its high temperature stress rupture properties. Large body of work has been reported in the literature on the precipitation of the $\gamma$′ phase. However, hardly very few reports are available on the evolution of $\delta$ particles in Alloy 718. The present paper reports the results of a detailed microstructural investigation carried out using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on the evolution of $\delta$ microstructure. Based on the SEM observations, three different mechanisms have been proposed for the generation of intersecting $\delta$ microstructure. In addition to the stacking faults in the matrix and $\gamma$′ particles acting as nuclei for $\delta$ phase formation, a new mechanism has been observed where the faults generated on the conjugate habit plane by dissociation of misfit dislocation on the interface of a $\delta$ variant acted as nuclei for another $\delta$ variant precipitation.},

A novel method for removing the inelastic scattering from neutron data is introduced, and the effect of Compton scattering on X-ray data is discussed. In addition the extent to which quantum effects can be discerned between heavy and light water is analysed against these more recent data. It is concluded that, with the help of modern data analysis and computer simulation tools to interrogate the scattering data, a considerable degree of consistency can be obtained between recent and past scattering experiments on water. That consistency also gives a realistic estimate of the likely uncertainties in the extracted radial distribution functions, as well as offering a benchmark against which future experiments can be judged.},

abstract = {Room temperature tensile and compressive properties of refractory complex, concentrated alloys (RCCAs) have been analyzed to explore correlations capable of anticipating ductility in this growing class of structural materials. The Pugh-Pettifor and Rice-Thomson ductility criteria are generally satisfied by the current dataset, but the dataset does not cover a sufficiently wide range to provide a critical evaluation. A previously suggested ductility criterion based on the average valence electron concentration (VEC) of an alloy, i.e. abrupt ductile to brittle transition at VEC = 4.5, is not supported in the present study. A revised VEC criterion is suggested, but the data supporting this trend is sparse and additional work is needed. These three ductility criteria are evaluated using only single-phase RCCA data. A new ductility criterion based on the RCCA yield strength ($\sigma$y) is suggested from the present work, using both single-phase and multi-phase data. RCCAs with commercially relevant tensile ductility have $\sigma$y ≤ 1200 MPa, and alloys with compressive ductility of ≥30{\%} (analyzed here to provide useful tensile ductility) have $\sigma$y ≤ 1500 MPa. Strengthening models to predict $\sigma$y in RCCAs may thus be used to anticipate alloys that may also possess useable levels of ductility.},

Mixing entropy and formation enthalpy can explain this behavior. After heat treatment at 1373K for 4 h, no new phase come into being but elements solute more fully. Compressive yield strength of the alloy gradually decreased from 1540MPa at room temperature to 371MPa at 1073K in as-cast state and decreased from 1483MPa at room temperature to 102MPa at 1073K after annealed. Comparing with the similar high entropy alloys, the structure combining silicide and continuous solid phase have a great benefit to the balance of strength and ductility.},

This approach has been proven efficient in determining the aging temperature with peak hardness. We observed that precipitation strengthening is the predominant strengthening mechanism for the studied superalloy made by laser powder bed fusion, and the grain size variation is insensitive to temperatures between 605 and 825°C. This new approach can be applied to post-heat treatment optimization of other materials made by AM, and further assist new alloy development.},

The single-phase BCC HfNbTaTiV alloy thus designed exhibited a high compressive yield strength of 1350 MPa and a high compressive ductility of {\textgreater}45 {\%} at the room temperature. This represents a 50 {\%} increase in yield strength relative to a HfNbTaTiZr alloy. This is attributed to the maximized solid solution strengthening effect caused by lattice distortion, which is estimated to be 1094 MPa. The alloy was also able to retain 53 {\%} of its yield strength and 77 {\%} of its ductility at 700 °C.

These atomistic simulation techniques, such as first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics allow atomistic-level resolution of structure, defect configuration, and energetics. Following the structure-property paradigm, such understandings can be useful for guiding the design of high-performance HEAs. Although there have been a number of atomistic studies on HEAs, there is no comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art techniques and results of atomistic simulations of HEAs. This article is intended to fill the gap, providing an overview of the state-of-the-art atomistic simulations on HEAs. In particular, we discuss how atomistic simulations can elucidate the nanoscale mechanisms of plasticity underlying the outstanding properties of HEAs, and further present a list of interesting problems for forthcoming atomistic simulations of HEAs.},

Even when it adds strength, oxygen doping renders metals brittle1–3. Here we show that oxygen can take the form of ordered oxygen complexes, a state in between oxide particles and frequently occurring random interstitials. Unlike traditional interstitial strengthening4,5, such ordered interstitial complexes lead to unprecedented enhancement in both strength and ductility in compositionally complex solid solutions, the so-called high-entropy alloys (HEAs)6–10. The tensile strength is enhanced (by 48.5 ± 1.8 per cent) and ductility is substantially improved (by 95.2 ± 8.1 per cent) when doping a model TiZrHfNb HEA with 2.0 atomic per cent oxygen, thus breaking the long-standing strength–ductility trade-off11. The oxygen complexes are ordered nanoscale regions within the HEA characterized by (O, Zr, Ti)-rich atomic complexes whose formation is promoted by the existence of chemical short-range ordering among some of the substitutional matrix elements in the HEAs. Carbon has been reported to improve strength and ductility simultaneously in face-centred cubic HEAs12, by lowering the stacking fault energy and increasing the lattice friction stress. By contrast, the ordered interstitial complexes described here change the dislocation shear mode from planar slip to wavy slip, and promote double cross-slip and thus dislocation multiplication through the formation of Frank–Read sources (a mechanism explaining the generation of multiple dislocations) during deformation. This ordered interstitial complex-mediated strain-hardening mechanism should be particularly useful in Ti-, Zr- and Hf-containing alloys, in which interstitial elements are highly undesirable owing to their embrittlement effects, and in alloys where tuning the stacking fault energy and exploiting athermal transformations13 do not lead to property enhancement. These results provide insight into the role of interstitial solid solutions and associated ordering strengthening mechanisms in metallic materials.},

@article{Fultz2010a,
abstract = {The literature on vibrational thermodynamics of materials is reviewed. The emphasis is on metals and alloys, especially on the progress over the last decade in understanding differences in the vibrational entropy of different alloy phases and phase transformations. Some results on carbides, nitrides, oxides, hydrides and lithium-storage materials are also covered. Principles of harmonic phonons in alloys are organized into thermodynamic models for unmixing and ordering transformations on an Ising lattice, and extended for non-harmonic potentials. Owing to the high accuracy required for the phonon frequencies, quantitative predictions of vibrational entropy with analytical models prove elusive. Accurate tools for such calculations or measurements were challenging for many years, but are more accessible today. Ab initio methods for calculating phonons in solids are summarized. The experimental techniques of calorimetry, inelastic neutron scattering, and inelastic X-ray scattering are explained with enough detail to show the issues of using these methods for investigations of vibrational thermodynamics. The explanations extend to methods of data analysis that affect the accuracy of thermodynamic information. It is sometimes possible to identify the structural and chemical origins of the differences in vibrational entropy of materials, and the number of these assessments is growing. There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the vibrational entropy of mixing in solid solutions, compound formation from pure elements, chemical unmixing of alloys, order-disorder transformations, and martensitic transformations. Systematic trends are available for some of these phase transformations, although more examples are needed, and many results are less reliable at high temperatures. Nanostructures in materials can alter sufficiently the vibrational dynamics to affect thermodynamic stability. Internal stresses in polycrystals of anisotropic materials also contribute to the heat capacity. Lanthanides and actinides show a complex interplay of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic entropy, even at low temperatures. A "quasiharmonic model" is often used to extend the systematics of harmonic phonons to high temperatures by accounting for the effects of thermal expansion against a bulk modulus. Non-harmonic effects beyond the quasiharmonic approximation originate from the interactions of thermally-excited phonons with other phonons, or with the interactions of phonons with electronic excitations. In the classical high temperature limit, the adiabatic electron-phonon coupling can have a surprisingly large effect in metals when temperature causes significant changes in the electron density near the Fermi level. There are useful similarities in how temperature, pressure, and composition alter the conduction electron screening and the interatomic force constants. Phonon-phonon "anharmonic" interactions arise from those non-harmonic parts of the interatomic potential that cannot be accounted for by the quasiharmonic model. Anharmonic shifts in phonon frequency with temperature can be substantial, but trends are not well understood. Anharmonic phonon damping does show systematic trends, however, at least for fcc metals. Trends of vibrational entropy are often justified with atomic properties such as atomic size, electronegativity, electron-to-atom ratio, and mass. Since vibrational entropy originates at the level of electrons in solids, such rules of thumb prove no better than similar rules devised for trends in bonding and structure, and tend to be worse. Fortunately, the required tools for accurate experimental investigations of vibrational entropy have improved dramatically over the past few years, and the required ab initio methods have become more accessible. Steady progress is expected for understanding the phenomena reviewed here, as investigations are performed with the new tools of experiment and theory, sometimes in integrated ways. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recently-developed high-entropy alloys (HEAs) containing multiple principal metallic elements have extended the compositional space of solid solutions and the range of their mechanical properties. Here we show that the realm of possibilities can be further expanded through substituting the constituent metals with metalloids, which are desirable for tailoring strength/ductility because they have chemical interactions and atomic sizes distinctly different from the host metallic elements. Specifically, the metalloid substitution increases local lattice distortion and short-range chemical inhomogeneities to elevate strength, and in the meantime reduces the stacking fault energy to discourage dynamic recovery and encourage defect accumulation via partial-dislocation-mediated activities. These impart potent dislocation storage to improve the strain hardening capability, which is essential for sustaining large tensile elongation. As such, metalloid substitution into HEAs evades the normally expected strength-ductility trade-off, enabling an unusual synergy of high tensile strength and extraordinary ductility for these single-phase solid solutions.},

The generalized stacking fault energy surfaces entering the model are calculated by using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) with pseudopotentials and the embedded atom method (EAM). Various core properties, including the core width, splitting behavior, energetics and Peierls stress for different dislocations have been investigated. The correlation between the core energetics and dislocation character has been explored. Our results reveal a simple relationship between the Peierls stress and the ratio between the core width and atomic spacing. The dependence of the core properties on the two methods for calculating the total energy (DFT vs. EAM) has been examined. The EAM can give gross trends for various dislocation properties but fails to predict the finer core structures, which in turn can affect the Peierls stress significantly (about one order of magnitude).},

abstract = {Phase diagrams are the key to understanding of high-entropy alloy formation. This chapter first presents the basics of CALPHAD (acronym of Calculation of Phase Diagrams) methodology and then details the procedures used in developing self-consistent thermodynamic databases tailored for HEA systems. A self-consistent thermodynamic database (PanHEA) has been developed for the Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni system that covers the complete compositional ranges for all its constituent binaries and ternaries, and it will be useful for future HEA design and processing optimization. HEA formation from the thermodynamic point of view is then illustrated for three HEA systems using TCNI7 database: FCC-forming Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni, FCC- and BCC-forming Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni, and BCC-forming Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-V-W systems. The FCC system shows large positive excess entropy while the BCC system shows small negative excess entropy, and these results are consistent with their vibrational entropies of mixing predicted from first-principle calculations presented in Chap. 10 “Applications of Special Quasi-random Structures to High-Entropy Alloys.” Addition of Al to CoCrFeNi stabilizes the BCC phase via the dominating enthalpy effect. The present study demonstrates that configurational entropy does not always dominate, and enthalpy and competing phases need to be considered in terms of phase stability. Applications of CALPHAD to high-entropy alloy design and microstructure development are then presented for the case of several alloys and satisfactory agreement between modeling calculations and experimental results is observed. Various isotherms and isopleths of the Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni system are predicted. Future perspectives on CALPHAD development including short-range ordering and kinetic database development pertaining to HEAs conclude this chapter.},

Despite numerous studies, the fundamental understanding at the electronic and atomic levels is still missing. We report a comparative study of four fcc HEAs of NiFeCoCr and NiFeCoCrX (X = Mn, Cu, or Pd) based on ab initio calculations using large supercells with 500 atoms in equal composition. After fully optimizing their structures using the VASP package, their electronic structure, interatomic bonding, partial charge distribution, and mechanical properties are calculated and compared, revealing the intricate interdependence among them. A novel parameter based on the quantum mechanical metric for internal cohesion, the total bond order density (TBOD), is used to interpret the calculated properties. The highest TBOD is found in Cantor alloy NiFeCoCrMn but lower in NiFeCoCrPd. The atomic radii vary depending on their local chemical environment. The resulting lattice distortions is validated experimentally in NiFeCoCrMn and NiFeCoCrPd. Moreover, modeling of Cu and Pd clustering in the supercell shows they have lower total energy in agreement with the observation of Cu-enhanced nano-participates in NiFeCoCrCu and Pd-induced concentration wave in NiFeCoCrPd HEAs.},

It is also demonstrated that isothermal annealing of the ball milled alloys in the temperature range between 350 and 650 °C significantly influence the magnetic properties, e.g. coercivity (Hc), remanence (Mr) and magnetic saturation (Ms) due to annihilation of defects such as stacking and twin fault along with dissolution and/or precipitation of magnetic phases in the Cu-rich matrix. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present an experimental approach for revealing the impact of lattice distortion on solid solution strengthening in a series of body-centered-cubic (bcc) Al-containing, refractory high entropy alloys (HEAs) from the Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al system. By systematically varying the Nb and Cr content, a wide range of atomic size difference as a common measure for the lattice distortion was obtained. Single-phase, bcc solid solutions were achieved by arc melting and homogenization as well as verified by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The atomic radii of the alloying elements for determination of atomic size difference were recalculated on the basis of the mean atomic radii in and the chemical compositions of the solid solutions. Microhardness ($\mu$H) at room temperature correlates well with the deduced atomic size difference. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of microscopic slip lead to pronounced temperature dependence of mechanical strength. In order to account for this particular feature, we present a combined approach, using $\mu$H, nanoindentation, and compression tests. The athermal proportion to the yield stress of the investigated equimolar alloys is revealed. These parameters support the universality of this aforementioned correlation. Hence, the pertinence of lattice distortion for solid solution strengthening in bcc HEAs is proven.},

abstract = {Transition metal elements, alloys, and intermetallic compounds often adopt the body centered cubic (bcc) and face centered cubic (fcc) structures. By comparing quantitative density functional with qualitative tight-binding calculations, we analyze the electronic factors which make the bcc and fcc structures energetically favorable. To do so, we develop a tight-binding function, DeltaE(star), a function that measures the energetic effects of transferring electrons within wave vector stars. This function allows one to connect distortions in solids to the Jahn-Teller effect in molecules and to provide an orbital perspective on structure determining deformations in alloys. We illustrate its use by considering first a two-dimensional square net. We then turn to three-dimensional fcc and bcc structures, and distortions of these. Using DeltaE(star), we rationalize the differences in energy of these structures. We are able to deduce which orbitals are responsible for instabilities in seven to nine valence electron per atom (e(-)/a) bcc systems and five and six e(-)/a fcc structures. Finally we demonstrate that these results account for the bcc and fcc type structures found in both the elements and binary intermetallic compounds of group 4 through 9 transition metal atoms. The outline of a theory of metal structure deformations based on loss of point group operation rather than translational symmetry is presented.},

Here we develop an approach to quantify the dependence of generalized stacking fault energies on the degree of chemical disorder in multicomponent alloys. We introduce the notion of a "configurationally-resolved planar fault" (CRPF) energy and extend the cluster expansion method from alloy theory to express the CRPF as a function of chemical occupation variables of sites surrounding the fault. We apply the approach to explore the composition and temperature dependence of the unstable stacking fault energy (USF) in binary Mo-Nb alloys. First-principles calculations are used to parameterize a formation energy and CRPF cluster expansion. Monte Carlo simulations show that the distribution of USF energies is significantly affected by chemical composition and temperature. The formalism can be applied to any multicomponent alloy and will enable the development of rigorous models for deformation mechanisms in high-entropy alloys.},

abstract = {Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are newly developed candidate materials for high-temperature applications. Among the existing RHEAs, NbMoTaW RHEA possesses the best mechanical properties with combined high strength, excellent thermal stability and softening resistance at elevated temperatures. However, the NbMoTaW RHEA is quite brittle at room temperature, which would restrict its application as structural material. Here, TixNbMoTaW RHEAs were developed by alloying Ti in the NbMoTaW RHEA. It shows that the room temperature ductility of the RHEAs increases from 1.9{\%} of the NbMoTaW RHEA to 11.5{\%} of the TiNbMoTaW RHEA, and the yield strength increases from 996 MPa of the NbMoTaW RHEA to 1455 MPa of the TiNbMoTaW RHEA. In addition, the TixNbMoTaW RHEAs keep stable single BCC structure up to their melt points. The present result indicates that Ti addition could effectively enhance both the ductility and strength of the NbMoTaW RHEA. The combined performance of superior mechanical properties and high thermal stability of the TixNbMoTaW RHEAs promises them an important role in engineering applications.},

abstract = {We investigate the ordering of oxygen and nitrogen interstitials in hcp Zr, Hf, and Ti using the corresponding oxygen-oxygen and nitrogen-nitrogen interactions obtained in the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations. Two main contributions, chemical and strain induced, to the interstitial- interstitial interactions are obtained by different techniques. We find that there is the strong repulsion between interstitial atoms at the nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor coordination shells, which is solely determined by the chemical interaction determined on a fixed ideal lattice, while both contributions are important for more distant coordination shells. The Monte Carlo simulations reveal the existence of three stoichiometric compositions, MeI1/6, MeI1/3, and MeI1/2, for the ground-state structures of interstitials, having different ordering types. Our results for the structures of oxygen interstitials are in good agreement with existing experimental data for the Ti and Hf alloys. In the case of Zr-O interstitial alloys, we correctly predict the general type of ordering, although the detailed structure is at variance the experimental observations. The ordering transition temperatures in some cases are overestimated by a factor of 2. We also predict the ordering type of nitrogen interstitials in hcp Ti, Zr, and Hf, which are similar to those in the case of oxygen interstitials. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The fracture resistance of Nb-Cr-Ti alloys or in situ composites of three different compositions, Cr2Nb, and a Nb-10Si in situ composite was studied at ambient temperature. The crack-tip deformation and fracture behaviors were characterized using near-tip measurement techniques and fractographic analyses. The relevant fracture and toughening mechanisms were identified and related to the microstructure. Despite fracture by a combination of cleavage and slip band decohesion, the Mb solid-solution alloy exhibited a resistance-curve behavior with a relatively high toughness and local ductility. The source of toughness was modeled and explained in terms of a cracking process that involved alternate slip band decohesion and cleavage. The in situ composites, on the other hand, exhibited cleavage fracture but considerably lower toughness with little or no resistance-curve behaviors. The difference in the fracture behavior appears to arise from two factors: (1) the presence of a high constraint in the Nb solid-solution matrix in the in situ composites, and (2) the lack of plastic flow associated with cleavage of the constrained Nb solid-solution matrix.},

abstract = {We revisit the meaning of stacking fault energy (SFE) and the assumptions of equilibrium dissociation of lattice dislocations in concentrated alloys. SFE is a unique value in pure metals. However, in alloys beyond the dilute limit, SFE has a distribution of values depending on the local atomic environment. Conventionally, the equilibrium distance between partial dislocations is determined by a balance between the repulsive elastic interaction between the partial dislocations and a unique value for SFE. This assumption is used to determine SFE from experimental measurements of dislocation splitting distances in metals and alloys, often contradicting computational predictions. We use atomistic simulations in a model NiCo alloy to study the dislocation dissociation process in a range of compositions with positive, zero, and negative average SFE and surprisingly observe a stable, finite splitting distance in all cases at low temperatures. We then compute the decorrelation stress and examine the balance of forces on the partial dislocations, considering the local effects on SFE, and observe that even the upper bound of SFE distribution alone cannot satisfy the force balance in some cases. Furthermore, we show that in concentrated solid solutions, the resisting force caused by interaction of dislocations with the local solute environment becomes a major force acting on partial dislocations. Here, we show that the presence of a high solute/dislocation interaction, which is not easy to measure and neglected in experimental measurements of SFE, renders the experimental values of SFE unreliable.},

abstract = {A long-standing limitation of first-principles calculations of substitutional alloy phase diagrams is the difficulty in accounting for lattice vibrations. A survey of the theoretical and experimental literature seeking to quantify the effect of lattice vibrations on phase stability indicates that they can be significant. Typical vibrational entropy differences between phases are of the order of 0.1 to 0.2kB/atom, which is comparable to the typical values of configurational entropy differences in binary alloys (at most 0.693kB/atom). This article presents the basic formalism underlying ab initio phase diagram calculations, along with the generalization required to account for lattice vibrations. The authors review the various techniques allowing the theoretical calculation and the experimental determination of phonon dispersion curves and related thermodynamic quantities, such as vibrational entropy or free energy. A clear picture of the origin of vibrational entropy differences between phases in an alloy system is presented that goes beyond the traditional bond counting and volume change arguments. Vibrational entropy change can be attributed to the changes in chemical bond stiffness associated with the changes in bond length that take place during a phase transformation. This so-called "bond stiffness vs bond length" interpretation both summarizes the key phenomenon driving vibrational entropy changes and provides a practical tool to model them.},

Such crystal structures, e.g. face-centered cubic (FCC), are advantageous in that they should offer multiple active slip systems usually observed in ductile metals and alloys.

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are an intriguing new class of metallic materials due to their unique mechanical behavior. Achieving a detailed understanding of structure–property relationships in these materials has been challenged by the compositional disorder that underlies their unique mechanical behavior. Accordingly, in this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the nature of local chemical order and establish its relationship to the intrinsic and extrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) in CrCoNi medium-entropy solid-solution alloys, whose combination of strength, ductility, and toughness properties approaches the best on record. We find that the average intrinsic and extrinsic SFE are both highly tunable, with values ranging from −43 to 30 mJ{\textperiodcentered}m − 2 and from −28 to 66 mJ{\textperiodcentered}m −2 , respectively, as the degree of local chemical order increases. The state of local ordering also strongly correlates with the energy difference between the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases, which affects the occurrence of transformation-induced plasticity. This theoretical study demonstrates that chemical short-range order is thermodynamically favored in HEAs and can be tuned to affect the mechanical behavior of these alloys. It thus addresses the pressing need to establish robust processing–structure–property relationships to guide the science-based design of new HEAs with targeted mechanical behavior.},

abstract = {We determine effects of substitutional solutes belonging to 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal (TM) series on volume, intrinsic stacking fault energy (ISFE), unstable stacking fault energy (USFE) and ductility parameter of Ni using first-principles calculations based density functional theory (DFT), considering both ferromagnetic (spin-polarized) and non-magnetic states of Ni. For each of the TM series, we find that volume exhibits a minimum for substitutional elements with half-filled d-orbitals (5 d-electrons). Reduction in ISFE of Ni is seen with all the solute additions except for Pd (in the non-magnetic case). Inclusion of spin-polarization has a pronounced effect on the fault energies and results in increase in both ISFE as well as USFE. In the non-magnetic case, USFE exhibits maxima for alloying with elements having five electrons in d-orbital. Except for Zr and Pd, substitution of other elements enhanced cleavage energy of Ni. Differences in the fault energies on alloying have been explained based on the electronic structure of the alloys. There exists a correlation between change in volume and change in USFE with substitutional alloying. It is envisaged that the exhaustive data generated here would not only form necessary input to multi-scale microstructural modeling, but also help in evolving simple recipes for design of new alloys.},

abstract = {This study reports the microstructure, phase composition, mechanical properties and oxidation behavior of NbTaTi and NbTaZr ternary equiatomic alloys. These ternary components, together with earlier reported NbTiZr and MoNbTi, are commonly observed in refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) with a single-phase BCC or multi-phase crystal structures. Therefore, the reported information about these ternary alloys is thought to be useful for the development of advanced RHEAs. While NbTiZr and MoNbTi are single-phase BCC structures, NbTaTi and NbTaZr are multi-phase alloys. NbTaTi consists of a BCC matrix and discontinuous, Ti-rich precipitates with BCC and FCC crystal structures. NbTaZr consists of a co-continuous spinodal mixture of two BCC phases, one of which is rich in Ta and Nb and another is rich in Zr, and it also contains a Zr-rich HCP phase in the form of coarse grain-boundary particles. NbTaTi has compression yield stress of 724 MPa at 25 °C, 268 MPa at 800 °C and 129 MPa at 1200 °C. NbTaZr is stronger, with the compression yield stress of 1027 MPa at 25 °C, 530 MPa at 800 °C and 183 MPa at 1200 °C. Both alloys show rapid oxidation with formation of complex oxides during holding at 1200 °C.},

In a first part, after a brief overview of the so-called ab initio methods with their approximations, constraints, and limitations, recommendations are made for a good usage of first-principles codes with a set of qualifiers. Examples are given to illustrate the power and the limitations of ab initio codes. However, despite the "success" of these methodologies, thermodynamics of complex multi-component alloys, as used in engineering applications, requires a more versatile approach presently afforded within CALPHAD. Hence, in a second part, the links that presently exist between ab initio methodologies, experiments, and the CALPHAD approach are examined with illustrations. Finally, the issues of dynamical instability and of the role of lattice vibrations that still constitute the subject of ample discussions within the CALPHAD community are revisited in the light of our current knowledge with a set of recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The vast compositional parameter space makes these alloys a unique area of exploration by means of computational design. However, as of now a method to compute efficiently, yet with high accuracy the thermodynamic properties of such alloys has been missing. One of the underlying reasons is the lack of accurate and efficient approaches to compute vibrational free energies—including anharmonicity—for these chemically complex multicomponent alloys. In this work, a density-functional-theory based approach to overcome this issue is developed based on a combination of thermodynamic integration and a machine-learning potential. We demonstrate the performance of the approach by computing the anharmonic free energy of the prototypical five-component VNbMoTaW refractory high entropy alloy.},

Since many high-entropy alloys showing outstanding mechanical properties are actually thermodynamically unstable at ambient and cryogenic conditions, the observed twinning challenges the existing phenomenological and theoretical plasticity models. Here, we adopt a transparent approach based on effective energy barriers in combination with first-principle calculations to shed light on the origin of twinning in high-entropy alloys. We demonstrate that twinning can be the primary deformation mode in metastable face-centered cubic alloys with a fraction that surpasses the previously established upper limit. The present advance in plasticity of metals opens opportunities for tailoring the mechanical response in engineering materials by optimizing metastable twinning in high-entropy alloys.},

abstract = {The physical basis behind the Ostwald ripening process for two-phase$\backslash$nmixture has been reviewed in detail, using the various theories developed$\backslash$nto describe this process. The Ostwald ripening, also termed second$\backslash$nphase coarsening, is generally thought to be slow, diffusion-controlled$\backslash$nprocess which occurs subsequent to phase separation under extremely$\backslash$nsmall under-saturation levels. The major advance for the description$\backslash$nof this process was made when Lifshitz, Slyozov and Wagner (also$\backslash$nknown as the LSW theory) published their papers more than fourty$\backslash$nyears ago. This classical LSW theory predicts that the ripening kinetics$\backslash$nand the particle size distribution function are applicable to dilute$\backslash$nsystems only [i.e. when the volume fraction (Q) of second phase approaces$\backslash$nzero: Q!0], in which particle-particle interactions are not important.$\backslash$nAfter the publication of the LSW theory, many experimentalists tested$\backslash$nthe veracity of the theory. Experimentalists have confirmed the prediction$\backslash$nof self-similar ripening behavior at long times. However, virtually$\backslash$nnone of the reported distributions are of the form predicted by the$\backslash$nLSW theory. The reported distributions are generally broader and$\backslash$nmore symmetric than the LSW predictions. It was later realized that$\backslash$na major problem with the LSW approach was the mean field nature of$\backslash$nthe kinetic equation. In order to remove the zero volume fraction$\backslash$nassumption of the LSW theory, the many theories have been developed$\backslash$nbased on the statistically averaged diffusion interaction of a particle$\backslash$nof given size class with its surroundings, using both analytic and$\backslash$nnumerical methods. Many attempts to determine the statistically averaged$\backslash$ngrowth rate of a particle either do not account for the long-range$\backslash$nnature of the diffusional field surrounding the particle, and/or$\backslash$nemployed ad hoc assumptions in an attempt to account for the diffusional$\backslash$ninteractions between particles. The strength of the diffusional interactions$\backslash$nbetween particles stems from the long range Coulombic nature of the$\backslash$ndiffusion field surrounding a particle. As a result, particle interactions$\backslash$noccur at distances of many particle diameters and restrict the validity$\backslash$nof LSW theory to the unrealistic limit of zero volume fraction of$\backslash$ncoarsening phase. More realistic models of the ripening process at$\backslash$nfinite-volume fractions (Q) of coarsening phase have been proposed$\backslash$nby various workers such as Brailsford-Wynblatt (1979), Voorhees-Glicksman$\backslash$n(1983), Marqusee-Rose (1984), Tokuyama-Kawasaki (1984), Enomoto-Tokuyama-Kawasaki$\backslash$n(ETK) (1986), and Yao-Elder-Guo-Grant (YEGG) (1993) models. Although$\backslash$na great deal of progress has been made in understanding Ostwald ripening,$\backslash$na fully satisfactory approach has not yet been found, and it has$\backslash$nremained a vexing problem in the field. At present, it is very difficult$\backslash$nto determine which of these theories best describes coarsening at$\backslash$nfinite volume fraction. The statistical mechanical theories, developed$\backslash$nto describe systems in which Q"1, employed the same microscopic equation$\backslash$nto describe the coarsening rates of individual particles, but different$\backslash$ntechniques to perform the statistical averaging. In addition, these$\backslash$ntheories can be distinguished on yet a finer scale. All of the theories$\backslash$npredict that the rate constant will vary as Q1/2 in this low volume$\backslash$nfraction limit. These theories predict that the scaled time-independent$\backslash$nparticle radius distributions become broader and more symmetric than$\backslash$nthose predicted by LSW as the volume fraction increases. Clearly$\backslash$nmore experimental and theoretical work is necessary in order to settle$\backslash$nthe subtle disagreement now existing between the various Ostwald$\backslash$nripening theories.},

It is often assumed that the contribution of the planar fault energy to the SFE has the same order of magnitude as the bulk part, and thus the lack of precise information about it can become the limiting factor in thermodynamic predictions. Here, we differentiate between the interfacial energy for the coherent fcc(1 1 1)/hcp(0 0 0 1) interface and the 'pseudo-interfacial energy' that enters the thermodynamic expression for the SFE. Using first-principles calculations, we determine the coherent and pseudo-interfacial energies for six elemental metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, and Au) and three paramagnetic Fe–Cr–Ni alloys. Our results show that the two interfacial energies significantly differ from each other. We observe a strong chemistry dependence for both interfacial energies. The calculated pseudo-interfacial energies for the Fe–Cr–Ni steels agree well with the available literature data. We discuss the effects of strain on the description of planar faults via thermodynamic and ab initio approaches.},

abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as promising next-generation structural materials. In order to understand the strengthening mechanism in these multicomponent alloys, a theoretical investigation is presented here in the framework of the Peierls-Nabarro (PN) model, which we consider would be appropriate for FCC HEAs due to their homogeneous feature, small lattice distortions and wide dislocation core structures. More importantly, there is no need to differentiate solutes and solvents in this model, which avoids the conceptual difficulties for such alloys. Using PN model, we calculate the dislocation core structures and Peierls stresses of the prototypical NiCoFeCrMn HEA and its six subsystems using the averaged gamma surfaces. The calculated stacking fault widths are in good agreement with available experimental data, and the obtained core structures are important for the future evaluation of the solute-dislocation interaction energies. The Peierls stresses in these multicomponent alloys are found to be much larger than pure FCC metals, and are generally in the same order of magnitude as the critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) extrapolated to zero temperature. The results indicate that in contrast to conventional FCC metals, the increased Peierls stresses in MEAs and HEAs could be responsible for their high yield stresses.},

The results of these calculations demonstrate that the SQS-based approach can be employed to derive the concentration dependence of the energies of twin boundaries, unstable stacking faults, and surfaces to within an accuracy of approximately 10{\%}. The SQS considered in this study contain up to 72 atoms and hence are small enough to be considered in first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculations. The application of the SQS-based approach in direct DFT-based calculations is demonstrated in a study of the concentration dependence of interfacial energies for 112¯1 twins in hcp Ti-Al alloys.},

abstract = {The deformation and flow of disordered solids, such as metallic glasses and concentrated emulsions, involves swift localized rearrangements of particles that induce a long-range deformation field. To describe these heterogeneous processes, elastoplastic models handle the material as a collection of "mesoscopic" blocks alternating between an elastic behavior and plastic relaxation, when they are loaded above a threshold. Plastic relaxation events redistribute stresses in the system in a very anisotropic way. A review is given of not only the physical insight provided by these models into practical issues such as strain localization, creep, and steady-state rheology, but also the fundamental questions that they address with respect to criticality at the yielding point and the statistics of avalanches of plastic events. Furthermore, connections are discussed with concurrent mean-field approaches and with related problems such as the plasticity of crystals and the depinning of an elastic line.},

abstract = {The effect of ordering on susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement of a Ni-base superalloy (alloy C-276) has been investigated by means of tensile tests in air and with hydrogen-charging in 1N-H2SO4 solution. The annealed specimen has exhibited intergranular fracture by hydrogen-charging, resulting in a marked reduction in tensile elongation and ultimate tensile strength. The mode of fracture was changed by aging at 773 K, and the transgranular fracture has been found to be dominant in the aged specimens. The susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, as identified by the test method used in this study, seems to be reduced by short-term aging, though it turns out to be increased again by further aging. The fractured boundaries have been characterized using electron channeling pattern (ECP) analysis of adjacent grains. It is found that the misorientation of grain boundaries plays an important role in fracture, and ∑3 boundaries, twin boundaries in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, are most likely to fracture in the aged specimens. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation has shown that a short-range ordering reaction from a disordered fcc lattice into an ordered Ni2(Cr, Mo) (Pt2Mo type) super-lattice takes place by aging, and hence, superdislocation triplets with APB (antiphase boundary) become predominant when deformed. It is also seen that in the aged specimens, deformation twinning is another mode of deformation, and this leads to the transgranular fracture at twin boundaries by hydrogen-charging. These results suggest that a change in the mode of deformation after aging plays a major role in fracture due to hydrogen embrittlement as a consequence of the heterogeneous interaction between slip dislocations and twin boundaries. {\textcopyright} 1992 The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, and ASM International.},

abstract = {Multi-principal elemental alloys, commonly referred to as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), are a new class of emerging advanced materials with novel alloy design concept. Unlike the design of conventional alloys, which is based on one or at most two principal elements, the design of HEA is based on multi-principal elements in equal or near-equal atomic ratio. The advent of HEA has revived the alloy design perception and paved the way to produce an ample number of compositions with different combinations of promising properties for a variety of structural applications. Among the properties possessed by HEAs, sluggish diffusion and strength retention at elevated temperature have caught wide attention. The need to develop new materials for high-temperature applications with superior high-temperature properties over superalloys has been one of the prime concerns of the high-temperature materials research community. The current article shows that HEAs have the potential to replace Ni-base superalloys as the next generation high-temperature materials. This review focuses on the phase stability, microstructural stability, and high-temperature mechanical properties of HEAs. This article will be highly beneficial for materials engineering and science community whose interest is in the development and understanding of HEAs for high-temperature applications.},

abstract = {Draw-bend tests, devised to measure springback in previous work, revealed that the specimen shapes for aluminum alloys can continue to change for long periods following forming and unloading. Steels tested under identical conditions showed no such time-dependent springback. In order to quantify the effect and infer its basis, four aluminum alloys, 2008-T4, 5182-O, 6022-T4 and 6111-T4, were draw-bend tested under conditions promoting the time-dependent response (small tool radius and low sheet tension). Detailed measurements were made over 15 months following forming, after which the shape changes were difficult to separate from experimental scatter. Earlier tests were re-measured up to 7 years following forming. The shape changes are generally proportional to log(time) up to a few months, after which the kinetics become slower. In order to understand the basis of the phenomenon, two models were considered: residual stress-driven creep, and anelastic deformation. In the first case, creep properties of 6022-T4 were measured and used to simulate creep-based time-dependent springback. Qualitative agreement was obtained using a crude finite element model. For the second possibility, novel anelasticity tests following reverse-path loading were performed for 6022-T4 and drawing-quality silicon-killed (DQSK) steel. Based on the experiments and simulations, it appears that anelasticity is unlikely to play a large role in long-term time-dependent springback of aluminum alloys. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {ABSTRACTK$\alpha$ Surface nanostructuring of engineering materials can be utilised to enhance materials performance for various applications. The aim of this work was to investigate the evolution of microstructure and its correlation with strengthening mechanisms in nanocrystalline commercially pure titanium (cp-Ti) produced by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT). The individual contributions of dislocation slip and twining as the deformation mechanisms during SMAT have been quantified using X-ray line profile analysis and corroborated with transmission electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction techniques. It is found that twining is operative only in the early stages of deformation. The absence of twin–twin intersections suggests that twining is not directly responsible for the initial refinement of grain size. Dislocation slip is the major deformation mode, which leads to the refinement of the microstructure by forming low-angle lamellar boundaries. Continuous dynamic recrystallisation is demonstrated to be the mechanism of nanocrystallisation in cp-Ti using detailed microscopic analysis. In contrast to previous studies, which have neglected the contribution of Taylor strengthening, it is observed that a combination of Hall–Petch and Taylor relationships can explain the strength only if separate set of parameters K (Hall–Petch constant) and $\alpha$ (geometrical factor in Taylor relationship) are used for the nanocrystalline surface and severely deformed sub-surface of cp-Ti. Taken together, this work provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms for engineering nanocrystalline materials.},

The deformed substructures were consistent with the evaluated activation volume (V*) indicating screw dislocation motion overcoming the Peierls-Nabarro stress barrier as the rate-controlling mechanism. The V* values were found inversely proportional to the yield strength. The monotonous behavior of the V* as a function of yield strength indicated the dislocation motion of BCC-MEAs/HEAs must involve overcoming the energy barrier involving multiple/group of substitutional solute atoms, simultaneously. Furthermore, for the first time, stress equivalence was observed in the BCC-MEAs/HEAs. The findings described thermally-activated dislocation glide mechanisms of the solid-solution strengthened BCC-MEAs/HEAs depended on the stress rather than the chemical complexity of the alloys.},

We show that it is possible to design special quasirandom structures (SQSs) that mimic for small N (even N=8) the first few, physically most relevant radial correlation functions of an infinite, perfectly random structure far better than the standard technique does. These SQSs are shown to be short-period superlattices of 4 16 atoms/cell whose layers are stacked in rather nonstandard orientations (e.g., [113], [331], and [115]). Since these SQSs mimic well the local atomic structure of the random alloy, their electronic properties, calculable via first-principles techniques, provide a representation of the electronic structure of the alloy. We demonstrate the usefulness of these SQSs by applying them to semiconductor alloys. We calculate their electronic structure, total energy, and equilibrium geometry, and compare the results to experimental data. {\textcopyright} 1990 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this paper, deformation behaviors (slip and twinning phenomena) for CoCrFeNi-based high entropy alloys with various alloying elements (Nb, Ta, Zr, V, W and Pd) have been efficiently investigated via rigidly shifting an FCC supercell at (111) plane along [112¯] direction, performing first-principles approach. This study provides a new insight accompanying an advantageous framework in order to design CoCrFeNi-based high entropy alloys through calculation of generalized stacking fault energy parameters, dislocation mediated slip and twinning propensities, the Rice-criterion and etc. It revealed that dislocation mediated slip and martensitic transformation are favored through addition of Pd element to CoCrFeNi high entropy alloys, while incremental rates of Ta, Nb, Zr, V and W elements increase the propensity of mechanical twining formation. Furthermore, phase prediction (volume fraction of face centered cubic and/or body centered cubic crystals) of selected HEAs was determined, showing inaccuracy of Valence Electron Concentrations (VEC) approach and thus brings a novel perspective on strength-ductility behavior. The electron density difference and density of states concerning electronic properties of HEAs were also estimated, explaining why and how alloying elements affect phase prediction.},

abstract = {Knowledge on structures and energetics of vacancy clusters is fundamental to understand defect evolution in metals. Yet there remain no reliable methods able to determine essential structural details or to provide accurate assessment of energetics for general vacancy clusters. Here, we performed systematic first-principles investigations to examine stable structures and energetics of vacancy clusters in bcc metals, explicitly demonstrated the stable structures can be precisely determined by minimizing their Wigner-Seitz area, and revealed a linear relationship between formation energy and Wigner-Seitz area of vacancy clusters. We further developed a new physics-based model to accurately predict stable structures and energetics for arbitrary-sized vacancy clusters. This model was well validated by first-principles calculations and recent vacancy cluster annealing experiments, and showed distinct advantages over the widely used spherical approximation. The present work offers mechanistic insights that crucial for understanding vacancy cluster formation and evolution, provides crucial benchmarks for assessing empirical interatomic potentials, and enables a critical step towards predictive control and prevention of vacancy cluster related damage processes in structural metals.},

Starting with the evolution of trajectories in space following the gradient of charge density, we derive an expression for the fraction of space neighboring each grid point that flows to its neighbors. This serves as the basis to compute the fraction of each grid volume that belongs to a basin (Bader volume) and as a weight for the discrete integration of functions over the Bader volume. Compared with other grid-based algorithms, our approach is robust, more computationally efficient with linear computational effort, accurate, and has quadratic convergence. Moreover, it is straightforward to extend to nonuniform grids, such as from a mesh-refinement approach, and can be used to both identify basins of attraction of fixed points and integrate functions over the basins. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {According to the principles of diffusional creep, the normal and tangent components of the velocity jumps between adjacent grains arise from, respectively, the climbing and sliding of disconnections along grain boundaries. Stationary deformation thus implies a balance between nucleation and recovery of moving disconnections. The model considers a periodic lattice of hexagonal grains with nucleation of disconnection multipoles at triple junctions. The strain energy coupled to the population of climbing disconnections is calculated by inferring that the internal strain field associated to disconnection pile-ups brings a distribution of tractions along GBs that is consistent with the field of diffusion potential gradient that drives disconnection climb. It follows that the distribution of the density of climbing disconnections is parabolic and that the dissipation due to the nucleation and recovery of climbing disconnections is equal to 50{\%} of the dissipation arising from diffusion fluxes. These results hold for both Nabarro-Herring creep and Coble creep. The analysis of the disconnection nucleation process highlights the sources of non-Newtonian behaviour and the existence of a threshold stress as an intrinsic feature of diffusional creep.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEA), a new class of engineering alloy, are characterized by high concentrations of multiple main elements. These alloys have revealed a vast and largely unexplored compositional space that gives substantial promise for the discovery of new and interesting alloys and properties. The majority of the current computational literature focuses on phase and stability predictions for rapid exploration of this compositional space, while most of the experimental literature focuses on structural analysis and basic mechanical properties of a few well studied alloy systems. These distinct focal points leave an opportunity to explore the production of property databases for high-entropy alloys. This work attempts to bridge the computational and experimental approaches by developing a method of calculating material properties from first-principles.Stacking fault energy (SFE) is investigated in the present work due to its use in modeling mechanical and deformation behavior, such as nano-twinning. Body centered cubic refractory high-entropy alloys are selected for their promising high temperature properties and minimal exploration in the current literature. Density functional theory (DFT) and special quasi-random structures (SQS) are used to calculate the SFE of these alloys. The results are then used to analyze the usefulness of these calculation methods in producing high-throughput databases for down-selection and development of these alloys. Additionally, several methods of increasing the speed and fidelity of these property databases are introduced and investigated, including: (i) a lower order averaging method for reducing the number of required calculations, and (ii) an inferential statistics method for predicting error bars on data sets.The possible stacking faults (SF) of the BCC {\{}112{\}} plane are reviewed and classified with a new naming convention of TSn, twinning sense, and NTSn, non-twinning sense. From this new classification and a theoretical analysis, five SF are identified and investigated throughout. These SF of interest are NTS, T, TS1, TS2, and TS3. The SFE for each fault are calculated for several elements and compared to computational and experimental literature. The calculated values for the NTS fault exhibit the same trends found in the reported values from a previous computational study. Mo and W have the highest stacking fault energies while Nb and V have the lowest. The calculated value of 24 mJ/m2 for the TS1 fault in W is compared to an experimental value of 14.5 mJ/m2 in impure tungsten.The AlNbTaTiV HEA with a single solid solution BCC phase is selected for testing of the newly developed calculation method. The use of SQS for SFE calculations is analyzed and it is determined that permutation averaging is required for calculations with HEAs. Ternary lower order averaging of a quinary HEA is shown to give good results for ground-state energy calculations, but poor results for SFE calculations.Quinary calculations show excellent results for HEA SFE calculations with ranges and ratios comparable to the verified single element SFE values. Inferential statistics and sampling are introduced to deal with the large number of possible permutations, 120 for a quinary. Inferential statistics allows the properties of the total population to be predicted from a sample set of calculations. The results indicate that a sample of only 20 values are required for precise calculations. Inferential statistics are then used to place predictive error bars on the HEA SFE calculations and sampling procedure. All sample SFE values were well within the predictive error bars when compared to the SFE calculated from the total population.},

Alongside this, gas turbine systems operate with low emissions and are more flexible in their operational characteristics than other large-scale generation units such as steam cycle plants. Gas turbines are unrivalled in their superior power density (power-to-weight) and are thus the prime choice for industrial applications where size and weight matter the most. Developments in the field look to improve on this performance, aiming at higher efficiency generation, lower emission systems and more fuel-flexible operation to utilise lower-grade gases, liquid fuels, and gasified solid fuels/biomass. Modern gas turbine systems provides a comprehensive review of gas turbine science and engineering. The first part of the book provides an overview of gas turbine types, applications and cycles. Part two moves on to explore major components of modern gas turbine systems including compressors, combustors and turbogenerators. Finally, the operation and maintenance of modern gas turbine systems is discussed in part three. The section includes chapters on performance issues and modelling, the maintenance and repair of components and fuel flexibility. Modern gas turbine systems is a technical resource for power plant operators, industrial engineers working with gas turbine power plants and researchers, scientists and students interested in the field. Provides a comprehensive review of gas turbine systems and fundamentals of a cycle. Examines the major components of modern systems, including compressors, combustors and turbines.

abstract = {Stacking fault energy (SFE) plays an important role in deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals and alloys. In metastable fcc alloys, the SFEs determined from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental methods often have opposite signs. Here, we show that the negative SFE by DFT reflects the thermodynamic instability of the fcc phase relative to the hexagonal close-packed one; while the experimentally determined SFEs are restricted to be positive by the models behind the indirect measurements. We argue that the common models underlying the experimental measurements of SFE fail in metastable alloys. In various concentrated solid solutions, we demonstrate that the SFEs obtained by DFT calculations correlate well with the primary deformation mechanisms observed experimentally, showing a better resolution than the experimentally measured SFEs. Furthermore, we believe that the negative SFE is important for understanding the abnormal behaviors of partial dislocations in metastable alloys under deformation. The present work advances the fundamental understanding of SFE and its relation to plastic deformations, and sheds light on future alloy design by physical metallurgy.},

The steel used in constructing the RMS Titanic was probably the best plain carbon ship plate available during that period, but presently not acceptable for any construction purposes. A metallurgical analysis of steel taken from the hull of the Titanic's wreckage reveals that it had a high ductile-brittle transition temperature, making it unsuitable for service at low temperatures. At the time of its collision with an iceberg, the temperature of the sea was -2 °C causing the failure.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the results of an on-going investigation to rank the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of precipitation strengthened Ni-based superalloys using a rising step load (RSL) technique in four-point bending. Alloys characterized include UNS N07716, UNS N09925, and UNS N07718 heat treated to various strength conditions. Hydrogen was introduced either in-situ via an applied cathodic potential (external hydrogen) or prior to testing by thermally charging in gaseous hydrogen (internal hydrogen). The RSL method measures the stress intensity required to cause propagation of a pre-existing flaw with and without the presence of hydrogen. Another method used to evaluate hydrogen embrittlement is the slow strain rate test, which characterizes material through the relative loss in ductility due to hydrogen exposure. While both methods provide a relevant measure of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility, fracture mechanics testing such as the RSL method offers more useful information for the design of components. Results indicate hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility is related to both the microstructure and the composition of the alloy. Measured fracture toughness values are also affected by the method of hydrogen exposure, however general trends among the materials are seen. In light of these results, the relative merits of the RSL testing method compared to slow strain rate testing is addressed, with a focus on overall applicability. Failures attributed to hydrogen embrittlement of Ni-based superalloys in off-shore wells have emphasized the need to identify the limitations of these alloys in environments where the potential for hydrogen embrittlement exist.},

When considering the reactions of dislocations with each other, it is necessary to determine the relative positions of the partials in order to correctly describe the configurations that are created in the reactions. Here we describe a geometric method for correctly determining the relative positions of the partials. The results we obtain can also be found by applying an axiom, or rule, given in the book by Hirth and Lothe. At the end of this tutorial we describe this axiom and apply it to some of the problems we have discussed. Our hope is that the geometric method we describe will give readers an intuitive sense of the geometry of partial dislocations and confidence in using the Hirth/Lothe axiom.},

The stress rupture properties were investigated at 760 °C/800 MPa, 850 °C/550 MPa, 980 °C/250 MPa and 1100 °C/140 MPa after different heat treatments. The microstructures of the alloy at different conditions were studied by SEM. The results show that c0 phase of the alloy became very irregular and larger after long-term aging at 1100 °Cfor 400 h.A very small amount of needle-shaped TCP phase precipitated in the dendrite core. The coarsened $\gamma$ phase and TCP phase dissolved entirely after rejuvenation heat treatment. The microstructure was restored and almost same with the original microstructure. The stress rupture life of the alloy decreased in different degrees at various test conditions after long-term aging. The stress rupture life of the alloy after rejuvenation heat treatment all restores to the original specimen more than 80{\%} at different conditions. The microstructure degradation of the alloy during long-term aging includes coarsening of the c0 phase, P-type raft and precipitation of TCP phase, which results in the degeneration of stress rupture property. The rejuvenation heat treatment succeeds in restoring the original microstructure and stress rupture properties of the alloy.},

The rolled plates were tempered and tested for tensile and Charpy impact properties following standard procedures. Hot-rolling increased the strength by more than 100. MPa, but reduced the ductility of the steel by more than 10{\%}. The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) was found to increase by more than 25. °C after hot-rolling as compared to As-received steel. Among the rolled samples, the plates rolled at 950. °C and 1050. °C showed higher upper shelf energy (comparable to As-received steel), whilst the plate rolled at 1050. °C showed the lowest DBTT. In terms of superior strength-toughness combination rolling at 1050. °C can be considered to be optimum. The results have been analyzed considering the effect of rolling on parameters related to the microstructure and crystallographic texture of the steel, such as, effective grain size, ferrite fraction, fraction of low-angle boundaries, fraction of cleavage planes on the main fracture plane and the fraction of slip planes along the 45° to the main fracture plane.},

The well-known Hall-Petch relation suggests that this high hardness should be further increased if the crystallite size of HEAs is decreased to nanometer scale. We prepared single-phased nanocrystalline (NC) refractory VNbMoTaW HEAs powders by mechanical alloying (MA). The achieved NC HEAs have a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure and an average grain size of approx. 6 nm. We further used a high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT) technique to consolidate the NC powders to achieve bulk NC HEAs. The evolution of phases, microstructure and mechanical properties of the consolidated bulk NC HEAs were studied as a function of consolidating temperature. The bulk NC VNbMoTaW HEAs consolidated at an optimized temperature of 1150 °C have an average grain size of ∼30 nm and a hardness of 11.4 GPa, ∼ twice that of coarse-grained refractory HEAs. This ultrahigh hardness has three origins: solid solution, grain boundary and dislocation hardening.},

abstract = {The face centered cubic (FCC) high entropy alloys (HEAs) showed highly attractive properties because of their simple crystal structures and low stacking fault energies. However, deep understandings of micro-alloying in FCC HEAs, including solid solubility, precipitates formation and stacking fault energy variation, remain unsatisfactory. In present study, we systematically investigated the solubility of Ti, Al, and Mo in the CoCrFeNi HEA and evaluated the effect of every single element on the precipitation behavior. The results showed that at 750 °C the CoCrFeNi matrix can separately dissolve up to 0.6 at.{\%} Ti, 4 at.{\%} Al, and 3 at.{\%} Mo. The roles of both additional and base elements in the precipitation behaviors were identified. Specifically, Co can stabilize the $\gamma$′ phase in the Ti-doped HEAs, while Al leads to the formation of B2 phase in the CoCrFeNiAlxsystem. The annealing stacking faults and twins in the matrix changed with the addition of different elements, which was mainly due to stacking fault energy variations. These insights will greatly benefit the design of precipitate-hardening HEAs and provide a deeper understanding of metallurgical behaviors of HEAs.},

For a single crystal of copper the agreement is not good, but, on the other hand, the plastic stress-strain curve for polycrystalline specimens of copper which is shown in fig. 1 is very nearly parabolic over a large range. The observations for iron seem to show that there is a small finite elastic limit, i. e. , S T may be finite. Parabolas corresponding with the existence of a small elastic limit and with no elastic limit have been drawn. It seems that the observed points lie rather closer to the former curve.

abstract = {The properties of dislocations are calculated by an approximate method due to Peierls. The width of a dislocation is small, displacements comparable with the interatomic distance being confined to a few atoms. The shear stress required to move a dislocation in an otherwise perfect lattice is of the order of a thousandth of the "theoretical" shear strength. The energy and effective mass of a single dislocation increase logarithmically with the size of the specimen. A pair of dislocations of opposite sign in the same glide plane cannot be in stable equilibrium unless they are separated by a distance of the order of 10 000 lattice spacings. If an external shear stress is applied there is a critical separation of the pair of dislocations at which they are in unstable equilibrium. The energy of this unstable state is the activation energy for the formation of a pair of dislocations. It depends on the external shear, and for practical stresses is of the order of 7 electron volts per atomic plane. The size and energy of dislocations in real crystals are unlikely to differ greatly from those calculated: the stress required to move a dislocation and the critical separation of two dislocations may be seriously in error.},

These SRF cavities are typically cooled to low temperatures by direct contact with a liquid helium bath, resulting in at least part of the helium container being made from pure niobium. In the U.S., the Code of Federal Regulations allows national laboratories to follow national consensus pressure vessel rules or use of alternative rules which provide a level of safety greater than or equal to that afforded by ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Thus, while used for its superconducting properties, niobium ends up also being treated as a material for pressure vessels.

abstract = {Medium-Mn steels are being thoroughly investigated as potential candidates for the 3rd generation of advanced high strength steels. Despite the wide experimental work, limited attempts have been presented to systematically optimize the chemical composition and heat treatment process to obtain desired microstructural features. In the present work, CALPHAD-based thermodynamic and kinetic modeling, coupled with multi-objective genetic optimization was adopted for the development of ?- ferrite containing medium-Mn steels with optimized microstructure, meeting set design requirements associated with retained austenite fraction and stability. A new sub-regular solution model for the prediction of the austenite stacking fault energy (SFE) was developed and compared to experimental literature data. A MATLAB implementation of the SFE model is provided as supplementary material. Pareto optimal compositions and associated process windows were identified via thermodynamic modeling coupled with the NSGA-II algorithm. A single optimized steel was selected for further consideration through kinetic simulation of the entire process chain including solidification, hot- rolling, accelerated cooling, quenching, and intercritical annealing, considering the effect of ?-ferrite on retained austenite stability and the martensite to austenite transformation kinetics. Temporal optimization resulted in the selection of an optimal intercritical annealing time. Model predictions were validated with metallographic observations on two different ?-ferrite containing medium-Mn steels, revealing excellent agreement between predicted and observed phase fractions.

In this paper, we propose the Landweber iteration of Kaczmarz type with general uniformly convex penalty functional. The method is formulated by using tools from convex analysis. The penalty term is allowed to be non-smooth to include the L1 and total variation-like penalty functionals, which are significant in reconstructing special features of solutions such as sparsity and piecewise constancy in practical applications. Under reasonable conditions, we establish the convergence of the method. Finally, we present numerical simulations on tomography problems and parameter identification in partial differential equations to indicate the performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Hedman2022,
abstract = {High-entropy materials have attracted considerable interest due to their unique, improved properties and large configurational entropy. Out of these, high-entropy ceramics (HECs) are of particular interest since the independent solubility of cations and anions results in increased configurational entropy. However, most HEC research considers only a single element occupying the anion sublattice, which limits the maximum attainable configurational entropy. Here, we expand our previous work on high-entropy borocarbides where both boron and carbon occupy the anion sublattice. By applying an ab initio based screening procedure, we identify six elements Li, Ti, V, Zr, Nb and Hf suitable for forming high-entropy borocarbides. With these elements, we propose six novel HEC compositions, and by computing their entropy forming ability, we identify that three are likely to form single-phase during synthesis. Material properties and lattice distortions for all proposed compositions are studied using density functional theory calculations with special quasirandom structures. The directional lattice distortions, a concept we introduce in this work, show that lattice distortions have an elemental and directional preference for certain HEC compositions. We also show that the novel inclusion of Li improves the mechanical properties of the proposed HECs, the details of which are studied using the electron localization function.},

The LTVC method is corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations and the results from the current most reliable data for binary, ternary, quaternary and quinary systems (96.6{\%}; 90.7{\%}; 100{\%} and 100{\%}, of correct solid solution predictions, respectively).

abstract = {The thermal expansion and adiabatic elastic constants of several single crystals of vanadium were investigated over the temperature range 4.2-300K. Although certain anomalies in the thermal expansion and in the elastic constants were observed at specific temperatures, in this paper emphasis is placed on the over-all elastic properties of vanadium, and attention is focused on those specimens in which the anomalies were less striking. The anomalies and their origin are the subject of a second paper which follows. The 4.2-K values of the elastic constants of a specimen exhibiting essentially no anomalous behavior were measured to be C11=23. 70, C44=4. 708, C′=5. 793, C12=12. 20, and the bulk modulus B=15. 98, all in units of 1011 dyn/cm2. Except for C44(T), the over-all temperature dependence of the elastic constants agrees with that predicted by current theoretical models. C44(T), however, exhibited an upward concavity over much of the temperature range, and was characterized by an athermal value lower than the measured 4.2-K value. Above 150 K the coefficient of thermal expansion was approximately constant for those specimens showing no anomalies, with a value $\alpha$≅8. 5×10-6K. Below 150 K, $\alpha$ decreased monotonically to 0 at ∼ 10 K. The value of the Debye temperature extrapolated to 0 K was calculated to be $\Theta$D(elastic)=403 K. {\textcopyright} 1971 The American Physical Society.},

The main characteristics required for such applications are high compression resistance, microstructural stability during thermal stress, hardness and corrosion resistance. To obtain such specific characteristics, the raw materials must be melted in inert protective atmosphere, and then heat treated for the homogenization of the microstructure and chemical composition. In the paper, there have been studied three types of high entropy alloys, HfMoNiTaW, 2HfMoNi2Ta and MoNiTaW obtained in the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) equipment. The heat treatment, performed at 800 °C with a holding time of 4 hours, allows obtaining a good homogenization of the chemical composition while generating a decrease in the microhardness, from a maximum value of 637 HV0.2 to a minimum value of 527HV0.2.},

Whole-genome transcription profiling of Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010, a strain isolated from infant stool, revealed a small number of commonly expressed extracellular proteins, among which were genes that specify sortase-dependent pili. Expression of the coding sequences of these B. bifidum PRL2010 appendages in nonpiliated Lactococcus lactis enhanced adherence to human enterocytes through extracellular matrix protein and bacterial aggregation. Furthermore, such piliated L. lactis cells evoked a higher TNF-alpha response during murine colonization compared with their nonpiliated parent, suggesting that bifidobacterial sortase-dependent pili not only contribute to adherence but also display immunomodulatory activity.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted great attention due to their many unique properties and potential applications. The nature of interatomic interactions in this unique class of complex multicomponent alloys is not fully developed or understood. We report a theoretical modeling technique to enable in-depth analysis of their electronic structures and interatomic bonding, and predict HEA properties based on the use of the quantum mechanical metrics, the total bond order density (TBOD) and the partial bond order density (PBOD). Application to 13 biocompatible multicomponent HEAs yields many new and insightful results, including the inadequacy of using the valence electron count, quantification of large lattice distortion, validation of mechanical properties with experiment data, modeling porosity to reduce Young's modulus. This work outlines a road map for the rational design of HEAs for biomedical applications.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThe microstructure and mechanical properties of a novel refractory AlNbTiZr high-entropy alloy (HEA) with a low density of ∼5.85 g cm−3 were investigated after arc melting and homogenisation at 1473 K for 5 h. The as-cast HEA exhibits a single-phase ordered body-centred cubic (B2) structure. A hexagonal Zr5Al3-type second phase is introduced into the HEA through homogenisation treatment, resulting in increase of the yield strength, ultimate compressive strength and fracture strain by 70 MPa, 308 MPa and 9.2{\%}, respectively. These results indicate that the introduction of the hexagonal Zr5Al3-type second phase into the B2 matrix can simultaneously improve the HEA strength and ductility, showing a strength–ductility combination superior to those of most reported refractory HEAs.},

abstract = {This volume presents a unified approach to constructing iterative methods for solving irregular operator equations and provides rigorous theoretical analysis for several classes of these methods. The analysis of methods includes convergence theorems as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for their convergence at a given rate. The principal groups of methods studied in the book are iterative processes based on the technique of universal linear approximations, stable gradient-type processes, and methods of stable continuous approximations. Compared to existing monographs and textbooks on ill-posed problems, the main distinguishing feature of the presented approach is that it doesn't require any structural conditions on equations under consideration, except for standard smoothness conditions. This allows to obtain in a uniform style stable iterative methods applicable to wide classes of nonlinear inverse problems. Practical efficiency of suggested algorithms is illustrated in application to inverse problems of potential theory and acoustic scattering. The volume can be read by anyone with a basic knowledge of functional analysis. The book will be of interest to applied mathematicians and specialists in mathematical modeling and inverse problems.},

Both normal and sigmoidal transient-creep curves were observed, according to the creep-stress and temperature conditions. Dislocation structures in Cu-16 at.-{\%} Al were examinedby transmission electron microscopy, to clarify the origin of the sigmoidal transient creep, in which an inverse transient creep at an early stage was followed by a normal transient creep after the creep rate had passed through a maximum. Average internal stress during creep was also determined by the so-called stress dip test. The main results obtained were as follows: {\textless}list list-type="order"{\textgreater} {\textless}list-item{\textgreater} Normal transient creep behaviour changed to sigmoidal with decreasing stress and temperature and with increasing aluminium content of the alloys.

The Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) drastically simplifies this procedure by implementing decision rules based on formal statistical analysis that frees the researchers from a constant monitoring during the calculation process and automatically "glues" together the input and the output of various codes, in order to provide a high-level interface to the calculation of alloy thermodynamic properties from first-principles. ATAT implements the Structure Inversion Method (SIM), also known as the Connolly-Williams method, in combination with semi-grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations. In order to make this powerful toolkit available to the wide community of researchers who could benefit from it, this article present a concise user guide outlining the steps required to obtain thermodynamic information from ab initio calculations.},

abstract = {Random solid solution alloys are a broad class of materials that are used across the entire spectrum of engineering metals, whether as stand-alone materials (e.g. Al-5xxx alloys) or as the matrix in precipitate-strengthening materials (e.g. Ni-based superalloys). As a result, the mechanisms of, and prediction of, strengthening in solid solutions has a long history. Many concepts have been developed and important trends identified but predictive capability has remained elusive. In recent years, a new theory has been developed that builds on one historical model, the Labusch model, in important ways that lead to a well-defined model valid for random solutions with arbitrary numbers of components and compositions. The new theory uses first-principles-computed solute/dislocation interaction energies as input, from which specific predictions emerge for the yield strength and activation volume as a function of alloy composition, temperature, and strain-rate. Being a general model for materials that otherwise have a low Peierls stress, it has broad application and has been successfully applied to Al-X alloys, Mg-Al, twinning in Mg alloys, and recently fcc High-Entropy Alloys. Here, the new theory is presented in a general and systematic manner. Approximations and limiting cases that reduce the complexity and facilitate understanding are introduced, and help relate the new model to various physical features present among the historical array of models, other recent models, and simulation studies. The quantitative predictions of the model in the various materials above is then demonstrated.},

@article{Shell2015,
abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is used in many industries as a non-invasive detection and measurement method, which works by finding permittivity changes in a viewing region. This usually consists of sensor electrodes surrounding a region of interest; however, this is not always possible as sometimes the viewing region is only accessible from a single side. In this case, a planar array ECT system can be used where the electrodes are all laid out on a co-planar surface. Initial simulation results indicated some features of sensor design which might aid image reconstructions. Five new electrode configurations were designed which incorporated these features in different ways. The designs were tested on their ability to reproduce a wooden block suspended in air and a water bottle buried in sand. Their performance was judged based on distance/depth detection of the block/water bottle, and the shape of the reconstruction. Singular value decomposition analysis was also performed on each sensor design to show their theoretical ability to reproduce the permittivity of the viewing region. Previously, similar work managed to reliably reconstruct objects at distances of 60 mm from the sensor. But in this paper, with a smaller sensor head, up to 90 mm was achieved with good accuracy. Combining the sensor designs together into a single sensor created the combined sensor, which was able to reconstruct objects with a much greater reliability, and was less susceptible to error or noise. With the right setup, the combined sensor was able to achieve up to 120 mm of depth detection. Also the combined sensor was able to detect a buried water bottle in sand up to 50 mm. Further simulation results on the combined sensor indicated that using up to 100 unique sensor configurations in the combined sensor was beneficial, but after 100 the amount of additional information gained was not significant. The results showed that the sensor head design can be optimized in order to produce improved reconstruction for planar array ECT. This improvement means that planar array ECT could potentially become a viable option for applications, such as landmine detection, particularly finding non-metallic objects, which cannot be picked up with conventional landmine detection techniques, such as metal detectors.},

abstract = {An investigation has been made of the types of stress-strain curve which it is possible to produce in single crystals of iron in the range of temperature between — 180°C and 213°C, for two different carbon contents. It is found that all the effects which can be produced in polycrystalline iron, i.e. cleavage fracture, mechanical twinning, simple and repeated yielding, and smooth stress-strain curves, can also be observed in single crystals containing 0.003 per cent carbon at approximately the same temperature. Crystals containing about 0.0005 per cent carbon also show all the effects except repeated yielding. The main difference between the single crystals of the two compositions is in the rate and magnitude of strain ageing effects. The temperature dependence of the initial yield stress is discussed for crystals containing 0.003 per cent carbon.},

The CPU time required by the improved algorithm to perform the Bader analysis scales linearly with the number of interatomic surfaces in the system. The new algorithm corrects systematic deviations from the true Bader surface, calculated by the original method and also does not require explicit representation of the interatomic surfaces, result- ing in a more robust method of partitioning charge density among atoms in the system. Applications of the method to some small systems are given and it is further demonstrated how the method can be used to define an energy per atom in ab initio calculations.},

@article{Otto2013,
abstract = {An equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy, which crystallizes in the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, was produced by arc melting and drop casting. The drop-cast ingots were homogenized, cold rolled and recrystallized to obtain single-phase microstructures with three different grain sizes in the range 4-160 $\mu$m. Quasi-static tensile tests at an engineering strain rate of 10-3s-1were then performed at temperatures between 77 and 1073 K. Yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation to fracture all increased with decreasing temperature. During the initial stages of plasticity (up to ∼2{\%} strain), deformation occurs by planar dislocation glide on the normal fcc slip system, {\{}1 1 1{\}}〈1 1 0〉, at all the temperatures and grain sizes investigated. Undissociated 1/2〈1 1 0〉 dislocations were observed, as were numerous stacking faults, which imply the dissociation of several of these dislocations into 1/6〈1 1 2〉 Shockley partials. At later stages (∼20{\%} strain), nanoscale deformation twins were observed after interrupted tests at 77 K, but not in specimens tested at room temperature, where plasticity occurred exclusively by the aforementioned dislocations which organized into cells. Deformation twinning, by continually introducing new interfaces and decreasing the mean free path of dislocations during tensile testing ("dynamic Hall-Petch"), produces a high degree of work hardening and a significant increase in the ultimate tensile strength. This increased work hardening prevents the early onset of necking instability and is a reason for the enhanced ductility observed at 77 K. A second reason is that twinning can provide an additional deformation mode to accommodate plasticity. However, twinning cannot explain the increase in yield strength with decreasing temperature in our high-entropy alloy since it was not observed in the early stages of plastic deformation. Since strong temperature dependencies of yield strength are also seen in binary fcc solid solution alloys, it may be an inherent solute effect, which needs further study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {Abstract The structure of asymmetric [110] tilt boundaries developed during creep of pure aluminium single crystals is studied using high-resolution electron microscopy. The small- and moderate-misorientation boundaries are composed of Lomer and 60° dislocations. Extensive image simulation is used to deduce the detailed core structures of these two dislocations. Comparisons with calculated elastic displacements indicate that the Lomer dislocation is not detectably dissociated in its (001) glide plane, or into the sessile Lomer-Cottrell configuration. The agreement between the observed atomic column positions and continuum elasticity is excellent, except for the innermost positions near the core of the Lomer dislocation. The core structure of these discrete Lomer dislocations also correlates well with previous atomistic calculations for a larger-misorientation $\Sigma$ = 19 boundary. A similar analysis of the displacements around 60° dislocations using isotropic elasticity indicates a slight dissociation of about 0.55 ± 0.15nm on the {\{}111{\}}. The lateral migration of boundaries in the thin transmission electron microscopy foils is also observed to occur by the motion of 60° dislocations within the boundary plane via a reversible Lomer reaction. The observation of an alternate core structure for the Lomer dislocation during this migration process is explained by the presence of a kink along the dislocation line. Multislice image simulations in which the structure varies with depth are used to study the effects of kinks and dislocation inclination on core structure images in thin foils. The implications of these observations in terms of dislocation glide on (001) in aluminium, are discussed.},

The order of strengthening effects of Re, Ta and W atoms from our calculations is consistent with relevant experimental observations.

abstract = {Texture evolution during room-temperature tensile testing of recrystallized equimolar CrCoNi was studied using electron backscatter diffraction and electron channeling contrast imaging on specimens from interrupted tests. Dominant deformation mechanisms included slip at low strains and deformation twinning at larger strains, which were accompanied by the development of a strong {\textless}111{\textgreater} texture parallel to the tensile axis. Highly deformed material also contained nanotwin/hcp lamellae, which have previously been hypothesized to act as potent barriers for non-coplanar dislocations. To examine this hypothesis, mean-field modeling was performed using the viscoplastic self-consistent framework with varying ratios for hardening by slip and twinning. In the optimal model, twinning produced approximately three times as much non-coplanar hardening as slip, which is larger than previous observations in other twinning-induced plasticity materials that do not form twin/hcp lamellae. Additional full-field elasto-viscoplastic simulations were performed using the fast Fourier transform (EVP-FFT) method to examine intragranular rotation and the effect of initial grain orientation on the deformation mode. Grains with initial orientations near {\textless}111{\textgreater} had the greatest propensity for deformation twinning while grains near {\textless}100{\textgreater} were more likely to deform by slip even at large strains. Excellent quantitative agreement was obtained between the experiments and EVP-FFT model.},

abstract = {Hydrogen embrittlement of a nickel-based superalloy IN718 was investigated using slow strain rate tensile tests. Post-mortem observation of fractured samples was performed to explore hydrogen-assisted failure mechanisms of the alloy. The results reveal that hydrogen charging reduces yield strength, tensile strength, fracture strain and work hardening rate. With increasing current density, yield strength and tensile strength reduce linearly and fracture strain decreases exponentially. Furthermore, the crack initiation and propagation in hydrogen-charged region depends on the distribution of $\delta$ phase in the alloy. For needle-shaped $\delta$ phase within the grains, the nucleation of voids takes place at the intersections between dislocation slip bands and $\delta$ phase due to the hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP)-assisted shear localization and possible hydrogen agglomeration. For $\delta$ phase along the grain boundaries, the impingement of slip bands and local hydrogen accumulation at $\gamma$-matrix/$\delta$ phase interfaces as well as hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE)-assisted decohesion lead to the void nucleation at the interfaces. Because of the decoration of $\delta$ phase at the grain boundaries, hydrogen-assisted cracking preferentially propagates along the grain boundaries. It is hence suggested that the synergistic interplay of HELP mechanism and HEDE mechanism can be used to explain the embrittlement of the alloy.},

Correlations were identified between the strength drops at 1000 °C and 1200 °C and the alloy compositions, room temperature properties, melting temperatures and volume fractions of secondary phases. The influence of alloy density on the temperature dependence of specific yield strength was also explored. The conducted analysis suggests that the loss of high-temperature strength of single-phase BCC RCCAs is related to the activation of diffusion-controlled deformation mechanisms, which occurs at T ≥ 0.6 Tm, so that the alloys with higher Tm retain their strength to higher temperatures. On the other hand, a rapid decrease in strength of multi-phase RCCAs with increasing temperature above 1000 °C is probably due to dissolution of secondary phases.},

abstract = {The effects of boron additions (up to 0.4 wt{\%} B) on grain-boundary chemistry and tensile properties of Ni3Al containing 24-26 at.{\%} Al were studied. Room-temperature ductility and fracture behavior of B-doped Ni3Al depended critically on deviation from alloy stoichiometry. As the aluminum content of B-doped Ni3Al is decreased below 25 at.{\%}, the ductility increases dramatically and the fracture mode changes from intergranular to transgranular. Auger studies indicate that the intensity of boron segregation to grain boundaries increases and the concentration of grain-boundary aluminium decreases significantly with decreasing bulk aluminum concentration. These results suggest that alloy stoichiometry strongly influences grain-boundary chemistry which in turn, affects the grain-boundary cohesion. Boron exhibits an unusual segregation behavior in Ni3Al, i.e. it has a strong tendency to segregate to the grain boundaries but not to cavity (free) surfaces. On the other hand, sulfur, an embrittling impurity, tends to segregate more strongly to free surfaces than to grain boundaries. The beneficial effect of boron is in agreement with existing theories of solute segregation effects on grain-boundary cohesion. The yield stress of B-doped Ni3Al decreases with increasing grain size produced by long-term annealing at 1000°C The yield stress obeys the Hall-Petch relation: $\sigma$y= $\alpha$o,y+ ky d1 2 with $\sigma$y = 163 MPa and ky = 8.2 MPa cm 1 2. The tensile elongation was initially independent of grain size, and showed only a moderate decrease from about 50-40{\%} with grain diameters larger than 110$\mu$m. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Light elements play a crucial role on the microstructure and properties of conventional alloys and steels. Oxygen is one of the light elements which is inevitably introduced into nanocrystalline alloys during manufacturing. Here, we report that severe plastic deformation can fragment the oxides formed in powder processing and eventually cause oxygen dissolution in the matrix. A comparative investigation on Cu-Fe nanocrystalline alloys generated from different initial materials, blended powders and arc-melted bulk materials which have different oxygen contents, reveals that fragmented oxides at grain boundaries effectively decrease the grain boundary mobility, markedly facilitating grain refinement. In contrast, those oxygen atoms dissolved as interstitials in the Cu-Fe matrix lead to lattice expansion and significant decrease of stacking fault energy locally as validated by density functional theory. Such oxygen-mediated microstructure gives rise to enhanced strength and superior structural stability. The remarkable tailoring effect of oxygen can be employed to engineer nanocrystalline materials with desired properties for different applications.},

During DFT calculations, the issue of different ways to calculate the GSF energetics in ceramic materials containing more than one element was addressed and applied. For 〈1 1 0〉/{\{}1 1 1{\}} slip, a splitting of saddle point in TiN was observed. For 〈1 1 2〉/{\{}1 1 1{\}} slip, a stable stacking fault at a0/3〈1 1 2〉 displacement was formed in TiN. For synchroshear mechanism where the slip was accompanied by a cooperative motion of the interfacial nitrogen atoms within the slip plane, a second stable stacking fault was formed at a0/6〈1 1 2〉 displacement. The energy barrier for the shuffling of nitrogen atoms from one state to another is calculated to be 0.70 eV per atom. In contrast, such features are absent in MgO. These differences highlight the influence of complex bonding nature (mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bondings) of TiN, which is substantially different than that in MgO (simple ionic bonding) on GSF shapes. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Refractory high-entropy alloys have drawn particular attention due to their high melting points and excellent softening resistance, which are the two key requirements for high-temperature applications. Their compositional space is immense even after considering cost and recyclability restrictions, providing abundant design opportunities. However, refractory high-entropy alloys often exhibit apparent brittleness and oxidation susceptibility, which remain important challenges for their processing and application. Here, utilizing natural-mixing characteristics among refractory elements, we designed a Ti38V15Nb23Hf24 refractory high-entropy alloy that exhibits {\textgreater}20{\%} tensile ductility in the as-cast state, and physicochemical stability at high temperatures. Exploring the underlying deformation mechanisms across multiple length scales, we observe that a rare $\beta$′-phase plays an intriguing role in the mechanical response of this alloy. These results reveal the effectiveness of natural-mixing tendencies in expediting high-entropy alloy discovery.},

abstract = {The effects of a uniform, internal concentration (1.74 at. pct) of hydrogen on the room-temperature tensile behavior of a single-crystal nickel-base superalloy, PWA 1480, have been studied. In particular, the interactive role of porosity and $\gamma$/$\gamma$′ eutectic on hydrogen embrittlement was examined. It was found that while there was no effect of porosity on tensile properties, hydrogen embrittled the $\gamma$/$\gamma$′ eutectic, leading to a lower strain to failure in specimens containing this constituent. Significant reduction in ductility also occurred in hydrogen-charged specimens where both porosity and $\gamma$/$\gamma$′ eutectic were effectively absent. These observations are correlated with the deformation structure and fractography and related to existing hydrogen embrittlement processes. Since hydrogen promoted planar slip and localized deformation, it is suggested that a hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity mechanism is operating not only in PWA 1480 but likely in other single-crystal and polycrystal nickel-base superalloys. {\textcopyright} 1992 The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, and ASM International.},

abstract = {In this work, we present the first observation and high-resolution analysis of Frank partial dislocations formed upon high temperature creep inside the L12 structure of a superalloy. The dislocations and associated planar faults are observed in a multinary Co-based superalloy after [001] tensile creep at 850°C and 400 MPa up to a plastic strain of 4.6 {\%}. With their a/3111 Burgers vectors the Frank partial dislocations create superintrinsic stacking faults (SISF) by positive climb motion via vacancy condensation. High-resolution analysis of the opposite end of such an SISF revealed a terminating a/6112 Shockley partial dislocation, which is connected to an antiphase boundary (APB). This indicates that the whole defect configuration resulted from splitting of a Lomer-type a/2110 matrix dislocation which became incorporated into the $\gamma$' phase. All observed SISFs exhibit solute segregation effects with enrichment of Co, Cr and W and depletion of Ni and Al. Leading Frank partial dislocations show pronounced Cottrell atmospheres of Co and Cr and asymmetric concentration profiles. The climb motion of the Frank partial is driven by an osmotic force induced by vacancy supersaturation and is assisted by solute segregation lowering the SISF energy. We discuss the forces acting on the aforementioned dislocations and their motion through the microstructure. Moreover, we propose a natural mechanism by which Lomer-type matrix dislocations can be generated enabling the formation and observed climb of Frank partial dislocations.},

abstract = {The recovery of pure aluminum single crystals at half the melting temperature, after room-temperature tension or compression in a 〈111〉 direction, was studied with particular emphasis on concurrent length changes and on effects of concurrently applied stresses below yield. Both effects were found to exist and to be directional. Recovery strains of the order of 10-4occur first in the direction opposite that during prestraining ('backward' flow), then in the 'forward' direction. Transmission electron microscopy showed a decrease of dislocation density in the cell interiors during the period of backward flow, and continued sharpening of the cell walls during forward flow. Forward applied stresses less than half the flow stress accelerated both the decrease in the flow stress and the sharpening and coarsening of the dislocation structure; reversed applied stresses during recovery had the opposite effect. The directionality of both the length changes and the stress effects support the concept of a polarized dislocation structure, already evident from the existence of a Bauschinger effect. The mechanism of recovery is proposed to be associated with the annihilation and rearrangement of dislocations in regions of forward internal stress, and thus with forward flow. The backward flow is shown to be a delayed unloading strain and not related to recovery of the flow stress. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {A comprehensive review of alloying effects in nickel-based single-crystal superalloys for turbine blades and vanes operating in a very aggressive environment of stress, oxidation and corrosion is presented. Exceptionally strong single-crystal superalloys have been developed containing increasing amounts of rhenium and decreasing amounts of chromium resulting in reduced environmental resistance. Interactions in a superalloy containing up to 15 alloying elements are complex and poorly understood. The superalloys can form brittle topologically closed-packed (TCP) phases unless the alloying additions are carefully selected. Development of superalloys with a required balance of strength and environmental resistance has been very challenging. Aluminium, chromium and tantalum are essential alloying elements for strength and environmental protection. Aluminium beyond an upper limit can lead to incipient melting during heat treatment necessary for achieving an optimum size and distribution of the $\gamma$′ phase. Rhenium and ruthenium additions contribute significantly to strength, while considerably degrading environmental resistance. Hafnium and yttrium singularly or in combinations improve oxidation and corrosion resistance. Progress in modelling based on thermodynamics, kinetics and regression analysis of prior data to simultaneously predict strength and environmental resistance has been limited since the strengthening and environmental degradation are distinctly separate mechanisms. The paper presents a critical review of alloying studies and provides an insight into future developments.},

abstract = {We investigate the generalized stacking fault energy (-surface) of paramagnetic-Fe as a function of temperature. At static condition, the face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the hexagonal close-packed lattice, resulting in a negative intrinsic stacking fault energy (ISF). However, the unstable stacking fault energy (USF), representing the energy barrier along the-surface connecting the ideal fcc and the intrinsic stacking fault positions, is large and positive. The ISF is calculated to have a strong positive temperature coefficient, while the USF decreases monotonously with temperature. According to the recent plasticity theory, the overall effect of temperature is to move paramagnetic fcc Fe from the stacking fault formation regime (K) towards maximum twinning (K) and finally to a dominating full-slip regime (K). Our predictions are discussed in connection with the available experimental observations.},

The objectives of this study are to provide a useful guideline for the Co-based alloy design with superior performances and new insight for understanding the nature of the fcc to hcp phase transformation. Evaluation of the GSFE values is based on the ratio of the stable and unstable stacking fault energy, the twinnabilities with three criterions for crack tip twinning, grain boundary twinning and inherent twinning, as well as the predicted critical twinning stress. It concludes that alloying with Cr, W and Mo atoms are expected to bring a significant increase in the tendency of the dominant deformation mechanism for the formation of partial dislocations and mechanical twinning of pure Co. The investigation regarding the electronic structure, such as interlayer distance distortion between a faulted and perfect fcc structure, atomic bonding, charge density distributions and density of states (DOS) in the present work can describe why and how alloying atoms change the GSFE values of Co-based alloys.},

abstract = {This article describes the effect of $\delta$p hase on the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) sensitivity of Inconel 718 conducted by notch tensile tests. Notch tensile specimens were subjected to proper heat treatment to produce various precipitation morphologies of $\delta$ phase. Hydrogen was charged into the tensile specimens before tensile tests via a cathodic charging process. The loss of notch tensile strength (NTS) due to hydrogen charging has been used as a criterion to evaluate the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity. The study suggests that $\delta$ phase has deleterious effect on NTS. Fracture origins of hydrogen-charged specimens locate near the notch surfaces. The loss of NTS caused by hydrogen charging can be greatly decreased by dissolving $\delta$. $\delta$-free Inconel 718 has been proposed for applications in hydrogen environments. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The screw dislocation glide, deformation twinning, and dislocation accumulation induced kink bands are identified as three deformation mechanisms that contribute to a large elongation above 20{\%}. The {\{}112{\}}{\textless}111{\textgreater} twins are activated at the beginning of the yield stage accompanied by sudden stress-drop and pronounced acoustic emission. Dislocations dominate subsequent tensile deformation, and the prevalent multiplanar dislocation slip promotes the formation of complex dislocation configurations (e.g., debris, dipoles, and loops) and dense dislocation networks. The twin bands and kink bands can further impede the dislocation motion meanwhile effectively alleviate stress concentration. The synergistic activation of these deformation mechanisms provides new opportunities to design ductile refractory medium- and high-entropy alloys.},

After subsequent tempering treatment the impact toughness in terms of upper shelf energy (USE) and ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) has been evaluated using Charpy impact testing (with 10 mm×10 mm×55 mm specimens) following ASTM E23 procedures. A substantial improvement in USE ({\~{}}20 J) and reduction in DBTT ({\~{}}20 °C) has been noticed for the 1025. °C treatment. The result has been analysed in terms of change in yield strength and ductility evaluated with tensile tests. Further, effects of microstructure, precipitate and texture on the change of DBTT have been studied with TEM and EBSD analyses. The results have been attributed to the smaller 'effective grain size', higher fraction of high-angle boundaries, presence of beneficial $\gamma$-fibre texture and dissolution of the pre-existing coarse precipitates in the reheated sample as compared to As-received material.},

abstract = {A new, fourth generation, single crystal superalloy has been jointly developed by GE Aircraft Engines, Pratt {\&} Whitney and NASA. The focus of the effort was to develop a turbine airfoil alloy with long-term durability for use in the High Speed Civil Transport. In order to achieve adequate long-time strength improvements at moderate temperatures and retain good microstructural stability, it was necessary to make significant composition changes from 2 nd and 3rd generation single crystal superalloys. These included lower chromium levels, higher cobalt and rhenium levels and the inclusion of a new alloying element, ruthenium. It was found that higher Co levels were beneficial to reducing both TCP precipitation and SRZ formation. Ruthenium caused the refractory elements to partition more strongly to the $\gamma$′ phase, which resulted in better overall alloy stability. The final alloy, EPM-102, had significant creep rupture and fatigue improvements over the baseline production alloys and had acceptable microstructural stability. The alloy is currently being engine tested and evaluated for advanced engine applications.},

This paper presents a novel approach to microstructural engineering of RHEAs to form an “inverted” BCC + B2 microstructure with discrete B2 precipitates dispersed within a continuous BCC matrix, resulting in improved room temperature compressive ductility, while maintaining high yield strength at both room and elevated temperature.},

These include mechanical testing to determine material properties; plasticity, which is needed for FEM analyses of automobile crashes; means of altering mechanical properties; and treatment of several modes of failure. The two principal responses of materials to external forces are deformation and fracture. The deformation may be elastic, viscoelastic (time-dependent elastic deformation), or plastic and creep (time-dependent plastic deformation). Fracture may occur suddenly or after repeated applications of loads (fatigue). For some materials, failure is time dependent. Both deformation and fracture are sensitive to defects, temperature, and rate of loading.},

@article{Yang2018,
abstract = {An important theoretical criterion to evaluate the ductility of metals with a body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice is the mechanical failure mode of their perfect crystals under tension along (100) directions. When the tensile stress reaches the ideal tensile strength, the pure W crystal fails by a cleavage fracture along the {\{}100{\}} plane so that it is intrinsically brittle. To discover the strategy to improve its ductility, we performed density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations to study the ideal tensile strength and the lattice instability under (100) tension for both W-Ta and W-Re alloys. Anisotropic linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory and Rice's criterion were also applied to analyze the mechanical instability at the crack tip under (100) tension based on the competition between cleavage propagation and dislocation emission. The results show that the intrinsic ductility can be achieved in both W-Ta and W-Re, however, by different mechanisms. Even though W-Ta alloys with low Ta concentrations are still intrinsically brittle, the intrinsic ductility of W-Ta alloys with high Ta concentrations is promoted by elastic shear instability before the cleavage failure. The intrinsic ductility of W-Re alloys is produced by unstable transverse phonon waves before the cleavage failure, and the corresponding phonon mode is related to the generation of 12(111){\{}211{\}} dislocation in bcc crystals. The ideal tensile calculations, phonon analyses, and anisotropic LEFM examinations are mutually consistent in the evaluation of intrinsic ductility. These results bring us physical insights on the ductility-brittle mechanisms of W alloys under extreme stress conditions.},

In particular, because of this efficiency, a large number of quinary alloy compositions can be quickly screened, leading to the identification of several new possible high-entropy alloy chemistries. The SSOS method developed here can be broadly useful for the rapid computational design of multicomponent materials, especially those with a large number of alloying elements, a challenging problem for other approaches.},

abstract = {We report the stacking fault energy (SFE) for a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) equiatomic concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs) derived as subsystems from the NiCoFeCrMn and NiCoFeCrPd high entropy alloys based on ab initio calculations. At low temperatures, these CSAs display very low even negative SFEs, indicating that hexagonal close-pack (hcp) is more energy favorable than fcc structure. The temperature dependence of SFE for some CSAs is studied. With increasing temperature, a hcp-to-fcc transition is revealed for those CSAs with negative SFEs, which can be attributed to the role of intrinsic vibrational entropy. The analysis of the vibrational modes suggests that the vibrational entropy arises from the high frequency states in the hcp structure that originate from local vibrational mode. Our results underscore the importance of vibrational entropy in determining the temperature dependence of SFE for CSAs.},

The tolerance for oxygen in Mo-35Re is several hundred ppm, but small increases in carbon or nitrogen render the alloy less fabricable. The contribution of valence electrons from rhenium to the molybdenum lattice is believed to be associated with the reduced interstitial solubility. The improved ductilities of Mo-35Re and W-30Re are associated with lower interstitial content, enhanced capacity for slip at low temperatures, and associated with low critical stresses for deformation by twinning, which appears to be afunction of rhenium content alone. Rhenium also significantly lowers the ductile to-brittle transition temperature of chromium to below - 196 deg C in bending.},

abstract = {The microdynamics of elevated temperature deformation in single and polycrystalline Fe-3 {\%} Si is examined in terms of measured minimum effective stresses. Effective stresses are obtained through the use of a new experimental technique based upon the response of dislocations to the internal and applied stresses. Primary and steady state creep are examined with respect to the measured minimum effective stresses. Modified stress relaxation and strain rate sensitivity techniques are used to study dislocation velocities at elevated temperatures. Dislocation density measurements are made in both steady state creep and stress relaxation experiments and are related to measured effective stresses. Results indicate that the effective stress dependence of the steady state strain rate can be described by e ̇g3s∝ $\sigma$min*2where $\sigma$min*is the minimum effective stress. Measurements of the tota within the subgrains yielded, pm∝ $\sigma$min*under the assumption that a constant fraction of the total dislocation density within the subgrains is mobile. The indirect measurements of dislocation velocity indicate that at elevated temperatures both the internal stress and mobile dislocation density change reversibly as a unique function of the effective stresses during stress relaxation and strain rate sensitivity tests. Comparison of steady state strain rates with measured dislocation densities supports the assumption of a linear dislocation velocity-effective stress relation. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

The coherent potential is necessarily a complex, energy-dependent quantity. We evaluate the model for the simple case of a one-dimensional alloy of $\delta$-function potentials. In order to provide a basis for comparison, as well as to see if a simpler scheme will suffice, we also calculate the spectrum of the same alloy using the average t-matrix approximation introduced by Beeby. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the average t-matrix approximation is not adequate for the description of an actual transition-metal alloy, while the coherent-potential picture will provide a more reasonable facsimile of the density of states in such an alloy. {\textcopyright} 1967 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The deformation responses of NiCoCrFe high-entropy alloy (HEA) under quasi-static (1 × 10-4-1 × 10-1/s) and dynamic (1,000-6,000/s) tension were investigated. A good combination of high strength and ductility is obtained under dynamic tension. The yield strength and true ultimate tensile strength is increased from 217 to 830 MPa at 1 × 10-4/s to 440 MPa and more than 1,000 MPa at 6,000/s, respectively. In addition, the engineering fracture strains maintain 60{\%}-85{\%} over a wide range of strain rates. The enhancements of strength and ductility originate from (1) the significant strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) mainly due to the presence of short-range orders/clusters (SROs/SRCs) as well as phonon drag effect of dislocations, and (2) the extraordinary work-hardening capacity due to dynamically formed nanoscale twins upon high strain-rate tension. The temperature and strain-rate dependence of the yield strength of the alloy are well modeled based on the thermally activated mechanism. Additionally, considering nanoscale twin boundaries as local sites for nucleating and accommodating dislocations, the dislocation density evolution model is modified and subsequently introduced into Taylor hardening model to accurately capture the hardening behavior of the current NiCoCrFe HEA. Hence, the distinguished work-hardening capacity under dynamic tension can be mainly ascribed to the low dislocation recovery rate and remarkable twin-induced dislocation generation.},

abstract = {An equation has been formulated to express the change in covalent radius (metallic radius) of an atom with change in bond number (or in coordination number, if the valence remains constant), the stabilizing (bond-shortening) effect of the resonance of shared-electron-pair bonds among alternative positions being also taken into consideration. This equation has been applied to the empirical interatomic-distance data for the elementary metals to obtain a nearly complete set of single-bond radii. These radii have been compared with the normal covalent radii, tetrahedral radii, and octahedral radii of the elements; their evident close relationship strongly supports the idea that the interatomic forces in metals are for the most part due to covalent bonds resonating among the available interatomic positions. It is found that chromium atoms, manganese atoms, and tin atoms exist in metals in two forms, a small, high-valent form and a larger, low-valent form. The two kinds of manganese atoms coexist in a-manganese and in {\ss}-manganese. In many metals each atom is attached to some of its neighbors by strong bonds and to others by much weaker bonds. An extreme case is {\ss}- tungsten, in which there are straight strings of strongly bonded atoms. Similar strings are also present in the a-uranium structure. The use of the radii is illustrated by the discussion of two compounds, cementite and AuSn. {\textcopyright} 1947, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Microstructural evolution of dynamically recrystallized (DRX) grains and grain boundary sliding (GBS) in the heterogeneous necklace structure of HfNbTaTiZr refractory high entropy alloy (RHEA) was studied systematically during high temperature deformation. Uniaxial compression testing was carried out to different strains at 1000 °C and a strain rate 10−3 s−1. Significant bulging of grain boundaries led initially to the formation of DRX grains. The fraction of DRX grains increased with strain, and typical necklace structures of fine (d ≤ 1.5 µm) DRX grains formed at strain $\epsilon$ ≥ 0.3. The DRX grains showed very limited grain growth, and heterogeneous microstructures composed of coarse unrecrystallized regions surrounded by the characteristic DRX necklace structure were formed at larger strains. Interrupted testing with marker grids revealed that DRX grains deformed by a GBS mechanism. The DRX necklace regions connected mesoscopically and also displayed diamond network morphologies, with unique “Y-shaped”, “T-shaped” and “X-shaped” junctions. The formation of different types of junctions were rationalized on the basis of GBS accommodated by local dislocation slip in unrecrystallized regions. The unrecrystallized regions showed preferred {\textless}001{\textgreater}/{\textless}111{\textgreater} micro-texture, consistent with conventional dislocation slip in the BCC crystals. On the other hand, the newly formed DRX grains initially had similar orientations to those of the parent grains, but they displayed a random texture with increasing strain, as expected from GBS. The randomized texture of DRX grains and the stability of DRX grains size represented GBS in the DRX necklace regions.},

abstract = {The thermal expansion and adiabatic elastic constants of several single crystals of vanadium were investigated over the temperature range 4.2-300K. Although certain anomalies in the thermal expansion and in the elastic constants were observed at specific temperatures, in this paper emphasis is placed on the over-all elastic properties of vanadium, and attention is focused on those specimens in which the anomalies were less striking. The anomalies and their origin are the subject of a second paper which follows. The 4.2-K values of the elastic constants of a specimen exhibiting essentially no anomalous behavior were measured to be C11=23. 70, C44=4. 708, C′=5. 793, C12=12. 20, and the bulk modulus B=15. 98, all in units of 1011 dyn/cm2. Except for C44(T), the over-all temperature dependence of the elastic constants agrees with that predicted by current theoretical models. C44(T), however, exhibited an upward concavity over much of the temperature range, and was characterized by an athermal value lower than the measured 4.2-K value. Above 150 K the coefficient of thermal expansion was approximately constant for those specimens showing no anomalies, with a value $\alpha$≅8. 5×10-6K. Below 150 K, $\alpha$ decreased monotonically to 0 at ∼ 10 K. The value of the Debye temperature extrapolated to 0 K was calculated to be $\Theta$D(elastic)=403 K. {\textcopyright} 1971 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The attainment of both strength and toughness is a vital requirement for most structural materials; unfortunately these properties are generally mutually exclusive. Although the quest continues for stronger and harder materials, these have little to no use as bulk structural materials without appropriate fracture resistance. It is the lower-strength, and hence higher-toughness, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature or, worse still, catastrophic fracture is unacceptable. For these reasons, the development of strong and tough (damage-tolerant) materials has traditionally been an exercise in compromise between hardness versus ductility. Drawing examples from metallic glasses, natural and biological materials, and structural and biomimetic ceramics, we examine some of the newer strategies in dealing with this conflict. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between the mechanisms that individually contribute to strength and toughness, noting that these phenomena can originate from very different lengthscales in a material's structural architecture. We show how these new and natural materials can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness and achieve unprecedented levels of damage tolerance within their respective material classes.},

abstract = {The Charpy impact energy was measured as a function of temperature for plain C-Mn steel with an ultrafine grain ferrite/cementite (UGF/C) microstructure and with a coarse-grain ferrite/pearlite (CGF/P) microstructure. Instrumented Charpy impact tests were carried out at 273. K and 77. K for the UGF/C microstructure. The steel with the UGF/C microstructure exhibited an upper shelf energy lower than the steel with the CGF/P microstructure, a higher lower shelf energy and the transition in impact energy occurred more gradually at a lower temperature. The ductile to brittle transition in the steel with the UGF/C microstructure was caused by a decrease in energy absorbed by ductile fracture rather than a change of fracture mode from ductile fracture to cleavage as occurred for the CGF/P microstructure. The fracture surface of the UGF/C steel in the upper shelf region contained large dimples and numerous small dimples whereas the fracture surface in the lower shelf region contained small dimples and cleavage facets. A lower amount of energy was absorbed in the transition region and the lower shelf region due to the decrease of dimple diameter and depth. Nevertheless, some energy was absorbed in the lower shelf because there were some small dimples even at the liquid helium temperature. In contrast, essentially no energy was absorbed in the lower shelf for the CGF/P steel because of typical cleavage fracture. The UGF/C microstructure has a high cleavage fracture stress. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A new set of AlFeCoNiCx(x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.17) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) were designed and fabricated. The microstructure, phase evolution and mechanical behaviors of the alloys were systematically investigated. Results show that the matrix alloy exhibits coarse columnar structure, while the C-doped alloys exhibit typical dendrite microstructure. The dendritic region (DR) is composed of single B2 phase, while the interdendritic region (ID) consists of FCC and E21phases and presents an ultrafine cellar structure caused by the coexisting of ordering and spinodal decomposition. Interestingly, both the strength and compressive strain greatly increased with the increase of carbon content. Particularly, the AlFeCoNiC0.08HEA possessed the most excellent mechanical properties, superior to many other HEAs with the yield strength, fracture strength, and fracture strain as high as 1115 MPa, 2517 MPa and 48.8{\%}, respectively. The mechanical properties of the AlFeCoNiC0.17alloy were weakened by the presence of graphite. Further, it is found that there is close relationship between the fracture morphology and alloy properties. Overall, in this study the improved microstructure and mechanical properties of the AlFeCoNi HEA have been accomplished by carbon doping, and our findings could shed light on a new alloy-design route to achieve bulk ultrafine structure materials with desired properties via the direct solidification.},

Yet there remain no reliable methods able to determine essential structural details or to provide accurate assessment of energetics for general vacancy clusters. Here, we performed systematic first-principles investigations to examine stable structures and energetics of vacancy clusters in bcc metals, explicitly demonstrated the stable structures can be precisely determined by minimizing their Wigner-Seitz area, and revealed a linear relationship between formation energy and Wigner-Seitz area of vacancy clusters. We further developed a new physics-based model to accurately predict stable structures and energetics for arbitrary-sized vacancy clusters. This model was well validated by first-principles calculations and recent vacancy cluster annealing experiments, and showed distinct advantages over the widely used spherical approximation. The present work offers mechanistic insights that crucial for understanding vacancy cluster formation and evolution, provides crucial benchmarks for assessing empirical interatomic potentials, and enables a critical step towards predictive control and prevention of vacancy cluster related damage processes in structural metals.},

abstract = {Refractory high entropy alloys containing elements from the Ti, V and Cr columns of the periodic table form body centered cubic (BCC) structures. Elements from the Ti column are noteworthy because they take the BCC structure at high temperature but undergo a shear instability and transform to the hexagonal (HCP) structure at low temperature. We show that the instability of these elements impacts the properties of the HEAs that contain them. In particular, the shear moduli are greatly reduced, causing increased dynamic contributions to lattice distortion. Relatively large size differences between elements of the BCC/HCP column compared with the regular BCC columns create additional static contributions to lattice distortion. These findings are supported by direct evaluation of elastic constants and lattice distortion in four representative HEAs. Comparing moduli of HEAs with those of compositionally averaged pure elements verifies the impact of BCC/HCP elements and allows us to estimate the compositions at which the BCC phases become elastically unstable, and these predictions could be useful in material design.},

Studying several high-entropy alloys and superalloys, we propose that most solid solution multi-component alloys are stable when $\lambda$*{\textless}0.16, generalizing the Hume-Rothery atomic-size rule for binary alloys. We also reveal that the polydispersity index $\delta$, frequently used for describing strain in multi-component alloys, directly represents the elastic energy (e) with e=q$\delta$2, q being an elastic constant. Furthermore, the effects of (i) the number and (ii) the atomic-size distribution of constituting elements on the phase stability of high-entropy alloys were quantified. The present derivations and discussions open for richer considerations of elastic effects in high-entropy alloys, offering immediate support for quantitative assessments of their thermodynamic properties and studying related strengthening mechanisms.},

abstract = {Elastic properties are essential to the mechanical performance of materials, and therefore, can be tuned to design high-performance materials. In this study, the elastic constants of the equiatomic ternary refractory multi-principal-element alloys, NbTiV, and MoNbV, were investigated, using in-situ neutron diffraction and first-principles calculations. The experimentally measured and theoretically predicted elastic constants show a good agreement. The alloying effect of adding Ti and Mo into NbV base alloy on the elastic constants is studied. Particularly, adding Ti elements into the NbV alloy results in the increase of the Zener anisotropy ratio from 0.59 to 0.99, leading to the formation of the elastically isotropic NbTiV alloy, while the addition of Mo decreases the anisotropy ratio to 0.52. Pugh's ratio (B/G), Cauchy pressure (C12-C44), and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$) are used to predict the brittle/ductile nature of the studied alloys, which is consistent with the mechanical results. The present work provides valuable insights into the design of ductile and strong refractory high-entropy alloys by tuning the elastic properties.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the conditions of elastic stability that set the upper limits of mechanical strength. Following Gibbs, we determine the conditions that ensure stability against reconfigurations that leave the boundary of the system unchanged. The results hold independent of the nature of properties of the loading mechanisms but are identical with those derived previously for a solid in contact with a reservoir that maintains the Cauchy stress. Mechanisms that control the stress in some other way may add further conditions of stability; nonetheless, the conditions of internal stability must always be obeyed and can be consistently used to define the ultimate strength. The conditions of stability are contained in the requirement that $\Lambda$ijkl$\delta$ijkl$\delta$ϵkl≥ 0 for all infinitesimal strains, where $\Lambda$ijkl=½ (Bijkl+ Bklij), and B is the tensor that governs the change in the Cauchy stress t during incremental strain from a stressed state $\tau$:tij= Tij+ Bijkl$\delta$ϵklSince $\Lambda$ has full Voigt symmetry, it can be written as the 6 × 6 matrix $\Lambda$ijwith eigenvalues $\Lambda$$\alpha$Stability is lost when the least of these vanishes. The conditions of stability are exhibited for cubic (hydrostatic), tetragonal (tensile) and monoclinic (shear) distortions of a cubic crystal and some of their implications are discussed. Elastic stability and the limits of strength are now being explored through first-principles calculations that increment uniaxial stretch or shear to find the maximum stress. We discuss the nature of this limiting stress and the steps that may be taken to identify orthogonal instabilities that might intrude before it is reached. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

This lecture looks at power plant for electricity generation and aircraft propulsion, considering likely limits and possibilities for improvement. There are lessons from land-based gas turbines, which can be applied to aircraft, notably the small increases in efficiency from further increase in pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature. Land-based gas turbines also point to the benefit of combining the properties of water with those of air to raise efficiency. Whereas the incentive to raise efficiency and reduce CO2 will force an increase in complexity of land-based power plant, the opportunities for this with aircraft are more limited. One of the opportunities with aircraft propulsion is to consider the whole aircraft operation and specification. Currently the specifications for new aircraft of take-off and climb thrust are not fully consistent with designing the engine for minimum fuel consumption and this will be addressed in some depth in the lecture. Preparing for the future entails alerting engineers to important possibilities and limitations associated with gas turbines which will mitigate climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions. DOI:},

abstract = {Structural materials with higher melting temperatures and better mechanical properties than superalloys are in high demand in refractory applications. A promising WReTaMo refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) with high strength at 1600 °C is fabricated by vacuum arc melting. The WReTaMo RHEA has a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure with a maximal compressive strength of 1140 MPa and Vickers microhardness of 654 HV at room temperature. The alloy displays a strong resistance to high-temperature softening, showing the high maximal compressive strength of 244 MPa at 1600 °C. The deformation of the WReTaMo RHEA compressed at 1600 °C maybe resulted from the grain boundary sliding, which leads to the propagation of the cracks along grain boundaries. Face-centered cubic (FCC) phase forms at the surface region of samples annealed above 1800 °C due to the diffusion of carbon atoms by gas carburizing in the graphite crucible at such high temperatures. The increase in hardness at temperatures above 1600 °C results from the solid solution strengthening of dissolved carbon. The forming ability of the WReTaMo RHEA is also discussed. This work presents a promising high-temperature structural material and fills the vacancy of the mechanical properties of Re-containing RHEAs at 1600 °C.},

abstract = {Although hyperparasitism frequently occur in parasitic insects, many aspects of this strategy remain unknown. We investigated possible fitness costs of hyperparasitism as influenced by host size. Our study was conducted with the facultative hyperparasitoid Pachycrepoideus dubius Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), which parasitizes host species differing greatly in size. We compared some fitness traits (level of successful parasitism, development time, sex ratio and offspring size) of P. dubius developing on large secondary/primary (Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)/Trybliographa rapae Westwood (Hymenoptera: Figitidae)) or small secondary/primary host species (Drosophila melanogaster L./Asobara tabida Nees (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)). In no-choice and choice experiments, P. dubius was able to develop on different stages of T. rapae (L2 (endophagous), L4 (ectophagous), and pupae) but that it preferred to parasitize unparasitized D. radicum pupae over pupae parasitized by T. rapae. Furthermore, in P. dubius, hyperparasitism was associated with fitness costs (lower level of successful parasitism, smaller adult size) and these costs were greater on the smallest host complex. We hypothesize that the size of D. melanogaster pupae parasitized by A. tabida may be close to the suboptimal host size for P. dubius beneath which the costs of hyperparasitism make this strategy nonadaptive. Hyperparasitism in terms of trade-offs between host quality and abundance of competitors is discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). We present a brief overview on recent developments in the field of strong and ductile non-equiatomic high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The materials reviewed are mainly based on massive transition-metal solute solutions and exhibit a broad spectrum of microstructures and mechanical properties. Three relevant aspects of such non-equiatomic HEAs with excellent strength–ductility combination are addressed in detail, namely phase stability-guided design, controlled and inexpensive bulk metallurgical processing routes for appropriate microstructure and compositional homogeneity, and the resultant microstructure–property relations. In addition to the multiple principal substitutional elements used in these alloys, minor interstitial alloying elements are also considered. We show that various groups of strong and ductile HEAs can be obtained by shifting the alloy design strategy from single-phase equiatomic to dual- or multiphase non-equiatomic compositional configurations with carefully designed phase instability. This design direction provides ample possibilities for joint activation of a number of strengthening and toughening mechanisms. Some potential research efforts which can be conducted in the future are also proposed.},

abstract = {The application of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) as coating materials has become an active research topic recently. Here an fcc structured CoCrCuFeNi HEA coating with a thickness of ∼1.2 mm was laser cladded onto a Q235 steel. The alloy coating possessed an excellent thermal stability in that no phase transformations occurred up to 1000 C (0.86Tm), and the dendritic morphology of the as-solidified microstructure could be kept to higher than 750 C (0.7Tm). After annealing the as-solidified coating at 750 C for 5 h, the lattice distortion in the rapidly solidified alloy was reduced, resulting in a moderate decrease of both the hardness and electric resistivity. Interestingly, profuse stacking faults ribbons were observed in the dendritic region of the alloy after annealing, driven by the thermal stress. This phenomenon provided a direct experimental evidence of the low stacking fault energy in HEAs. The thermodynamic origin of the thermal stability for HEAs was proposed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here we report a strategy to intrinsically toughen strong-yet-brittle HEAs via altering the valence electron concentration (VEC) of precipitates. It was found that a decrease of the VEC of precipitates by Co substitution for Ni atoms effectively destabilizes the brittle hexagonal-ordered precipitate and promotes the formation of ductile cubic-ordered nano-precipitates in Ni–Co–Fe–Cr–Ti system. Benefiting from such a transformation, a fivefold enhancement of tensile elongation (from 7{\%} to 35{\%}) was successfully achieved together with a simultaneously improved strength up to ∼ 1.35 GPa.},

The structures possess local pair and multisite correlation functions that closely mimic those of the random bcc alloy. We employed the SQSs to predict the mixing enthalpies, nearest neighbor bond length distributions and electronic density of states of bcc Mo-Nb-Ta and Mo-Nb-V solid solutions. Our convergence tests indicate that even small-sized SQSs can give reliable results. Based on the SQS energetics, the predicting powers of the existing empirical ternary extrapolation models were assessed. The present results suggest that it is important to take into account the ternary interaction parameter in order to accurately describe the thermodynamic behaviors of ternary alloys. The proposed SQSs are quite general and can be applied to other ternary bcc alloys. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Emphasis is put on primary and anelastic creep and their dependencies on processed microstructure and applied stress. The results of steady state creep are also reported. It is shown that the primary creep strain depends strongly on microstructure. Its dependence on stress is linear in the low stress regime, whereas a weak dependence is observed for high applied stresses. Unloading experiments lead to a time-dependent strain recovery that is also dependent on microstructure and prior stress. Unloading in the primary creep regime results in the recovery of almost all of the creep strain. However, a substantial strain recovery was also obtained upon unloading from steady state. It is shown that primary and anelastic creep strains are intimately related, and depend on microstructure and stress. The results are discussed with respect to existing dislocation creep models and the observed dislocation structures.},

abstract = {Transition metals (TMs) are extensively used to improve the mechanical properties of niobium based alloy, one of the most promising high-temperature materials. Yet the microscopic mechanism of the alloying effects of these transition metals on the mechanical properties is unclear. In this study, we have mapped out the composition-SFE-ductility relationship for TM-alloyed Nb systems by comprehensively investigating the unstable stacking fault energies (SFEs), $\gamma$us, and the ductility in binary and ternary Nb alloys using the first-principles calculations. It is found that the valence electron concentration can be used as the key descriptor to evaluate the SFE of Nb matrix, which is applicable to both binary and ternary alloys. The microscopic mechanism arises from the electron redistribution in the local stacking fault area. Moreover, for ternary Nb-Ti based alloys, the interaction between Ti and the third alloying elements has negligible effect on the SFE of the systems, and the valence-electron rule still dominates. The alloying effects on the ductility are further illustrated based on the ratio between surface energies and SFEs. The composition-SFE-ductility map obtained by our theoretical calculations is calibrated by available experimental data.},

abstract = {Combining cluster expansion (CE) method with one dimensional axial Ising model, this work investigated the effects of alloying elements and configurational variations due to temperature on the stacking fault energy (SFE) of FCC Ni binary alloys. Ensembles of large numbers of atomistic structures, each with more than {\~{}}400 atoms, were generated to consider sufficient long-range chemical disorder and temperature effects due to configurational entropy. A Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm was used to generate these structures, whose energies were then evaluated based on the effective cluster interactions obtained from CE. As a baseline, this work had shown the SFE of pure Ni and Al to be 127 mJ/m2 and 137 mJ/m2, respectively, which agreed with the experimental values of 125 mJ/m2 and 150 mJ/m2 reported in the literature. Additions of Al, Ti, Cr and Co to pure Ni were found to decrease the SFE to different extents. Although temperature does not strongly influence the SFE of the FCC Ni-Al and Ni-Cr binary alloys, it can lead to significant changes to the SFE of the FCC Ni-Ti and Ni-Co alloys. While effects of temperature and composition on SFE observed in this work were calculated from binary Ni alloys, the general trends are nonetheless expected to be valid in the $\gamma$ phase of multicomponent Ni superalloys.},

abstract = {In current study, the generalized stacking fault curves for AlCoxCrFeNi (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 2) high entropy alloys have been successfully estimated to gain a better understanding on the deformation behavior (slip and twinning phenomena) utilizing first-principles study based on density functional theory. Through this method, four main generalized stacking fault energy parameters (unstable, intrinsic, unstable twinning and extrinsic stacking fault energies), the rivalry between twinning and dislocation mediated slip (crack tip twinning, grain boundary twinning, and critical twin stress) as well as the Rice-criterion were reported. It was found that dislocation mediated slip and martensitic transformation presumably overcome the plastic deformation as Co content increases. To further reveal the nature of strength and ductility, investigation of density of states and electron density difference were carried out to reflect how increasing Co content affect the strength and ductility. The above mentioned calculations provide a beneficial guideline for designing AlCoCrFeNi HEAs in relation with superior properties (special harmony between strength and ductility). Amidst all high entropy alloys in this study, AlCo2CrFeNi alloy exhibits a superior balance between ductility and strength.},

abstract = {Nickel-based superalloys have attracted immense attention in the oil and gas industry due to their outstanding combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. In corrosive service environment, hydrogen embrittlement is a severe issue. In the present work, the susceptibility of two precipitation-hardened nickel-based alloys, i.e., Alloy 718 and Alloy 725, to hydrogen embrittlement was studied using slow strain-rate tensile test and advanced characterization techniques. The mechanical properties and fracture behavior of these two alloys were compared in both hydrogen-free and hydrogen-charged conditions. In the presence of hydrogen, Alloy 718 failed prevalently through a combination of transgranular and intergranular cracking behavior, while Alloy 725 failed primarily through intergranular failure with a considerably lower resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. This distinction was attributed to their different microstructures and different types of precipitates along grain boundaries. Specifically, in Alloy 725, the decoration of (Cr, Mo)-rich precipitates at grain boundaries distort the local structures and cause such boundaries to be vulnerable to hydrogen attack, thus promoting intergranular cracking.},

The core structure of ½[111] screw dislocations continuously varies from compact to 3-fold with decreasing Nb content. The screw dislocation core structures in NbTiZr and Nb 1.5 TiZr 0.5 are calculated using Embedded Atom Potentials (Johnson-Zhou) and compared with first-principles calculations of the screw dislocation in a quasi-random structure. In both simulations the dislocation core spreads on different (110) glide planes as the composition varies along the dislocation line in stoichiometric NbTiZr. The Nb-rich composition Nb 1.5 TiZr 0.5 shows a compact core with very little core structure variation along the dislocation line in both First Principles and atomistic simulations. The screw dislocation deposits interstitial and vacancy dipole debris as it moves under stress. Average solute-dislocation core interaction energies in NbTiZr, Nb 1.5 TiZr 0.5 and Nb 0.5 TiZr 1.5 are derived from the average interatomic potential derived for each of the three systems. The interaction energies are used to determine the critical stress for the motion of ½[111] screw dislocations in the three systems as a function of temperature using the Suzuki model of kink migration controlled mobility developed for concentrated BCC random alloys. This analysis shows that the relatively high barrier for kink migration caused by fluctuations in solute concentration along the screw dislocation line and the dipole dragging stress associated with the screw dislocation motion results in a shallow fall-off of critical stress with temperature in these alloys as compared to simple BCC metals. Finally, the screw dislocation to edge and mixed dislocation critical stress ratio in NbTiZr are shown to be low, ∼2 at 5 K, in contrast to simple BCC metals, where it could be as high as 100–1000.},

@article{Rice1994,
abstract = {The activation energy for dislocation nucleation from a stressed crack tip is calculated within the Peierls framework, in which a periodic shear stress vs displacement relation is assumed to hold on a slip plane emanating from the crack tip. Previous results have revealed that the critical G (energy release rate corresponding to the "screened" crack tip stress field) for dislocation nucleation scales with $\gamma$us (the unstable stacking energy), in an analysis which neglects any coupling between tension and shear along the slip plane. That analysis represents instantaneous nucleation and takes thermal effects into account only via the weak temperature dependence of the elastic constants. In this work, the energy required to thermally activate a stable, incipient dislocation into its unstable "saddle-point" configuration is directly calculated for loads less than that critical value. We do so only with the simplest case, for which the slip plane is a prolongation of the crack plane. A first calculation reported is 2D in nature, and hence reveals an activation energy per unit length. A more realistic scheme for thermal activation involves the emission of a dislocation loop, an inherently 3D phenomenon. Asymptotic calculations of the activation energy for loads close to the critical load are performed in 2D and in 3D. It is found that the 3D activation energy generally corresponds to the 2D activation energy per unit length multiplied by about 5-10 Burgers vectors (but by as many as 17 very near to the critical loading). Implications for the emission of dislocations in copper, $\alpha$-iron, and silicon at elevated temperature are discussed. The effects of thermal activation are very significant in lowering the load for emission. Also, the appropriate activation energy to correspond to molecular dynamics simulations of crack tips is discussed. Such simulations, as typically carried out with only a few atomic planes in a periodic repeat direction parallel to the crack tip, are shown to greatly exaggerate the (already large) effects of temperature on dislocation nucleation. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {We present an efficient and accurate method for calculating electronic structure and related properties of random alloys with a proper treatment of local environment effects. The method is a generalization of the locally self-consistent Green's-function technique for the exact muffin-tin orbital method. An alloy system in the calculations is represented by a supercell with a certain set of atomic-distribution correlation functions. The Green's function for each atom in the supercell is obtained by embedding the cluster of neighboring atoms lying within a local interaction zone (LIZ) into an effective medium and solving the cluster Dyson equation exactly. The key ingredients of the method are locality, which makes it linearly scaling with the number of atoms in the supercell, and coherent-potential self-consistency of the effective medium, which results in a fast convergence of the electronic structure with respect to the LIZ size. To test the performance and accuracy of the method, we apply it to two systems: Fe-rich bcc-FeCr random alloy with and without a short-range order, and a Cr impurity on the Fe surface. Both cases demonstrate the importance of taking into account the local environment effects for correct description of magnetic and bulk properties.},

abstract = {An equiatomic, single-phase TiZrNbHfTa high-entropy alloy was subjected to high-pressure torsion, leading to a grain size below 100 nm. Introducing a nanocrystalline microstructure to the material should help to accelerate a possible phase decomposition of the material by having a high amount of fast diffusion pathways and possible nucleation sites in the form of grain boundaries. In order to test the materials thermodynamic stability the nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy. was subjected to various heat treatments for temperatures between 300 °C and 1100 °C. Isochronal heat treatments (1 h) resulted in a hardness increase from 420 HV1 for the as-processed state to 530 HV1 for an annealing temperature of 500 °C, while for temperatures of 700 °C and higher a softening compared to the as-processed state occurred. In order to clarify this unexpected annealing response, analysis of selected microstructural states was performed utilizing electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction as well as mechanical testing to gain further information on microstructure-property relationships. Complementary, thermodynamic simulations were performed via the Calphad approach and compared to the experimental results. A phase decomposition of the originally equimolar single-phase high-entropy alloy into a NbTa-rich body-centered cubic phase and ZrHf-rich phases, which occurred in two different crystal structures depending on the annealing temperature, was the main reason for the property changes. The obtained results not only give valuable new insights into the phase stability of the TiZrNbHfTa alloy, but also demonstrate the impact of the newly forming phases in regards to mechanical properties and its implication for a possible practical application of this alloy.},

Therefore, a high-throughput first-principles study of Mo-V-Nb-Ti-Zr, a refractory MPEA, was conducted to gain insights into the underlying microstructures. Using Monte-Carlo simulations powered by cluster expansion, we uncover the principles governing the MPEA's microstructures across a large compositional space that includes non-equiatomic compositions and encompasses the constituent binaries, ternaries, and quaternaries. In the spirit of Hume-Rothery rules for complete solid solubility, we present a quantitative expression for predicting solid solution formation from the composition. Within a consistent framework, our results reproduce the microstructural observations (solid solution vs. segregation) from numerous experiments and provide microstructural predictions for unexplored regions in the compositional space.

Factors such as solute trapping, energies of defects need to be considered while predicting phases in HEAs prepared by non-equilibrium processes. The effects of light elements (Al, Ti, Si, alkali and alkaline earth metals) on the phase formations in HEAs are discussed. Especially, intermetallics predicted for Si-containing HEAs by traditional CALPHAD calculation can be suppressed in rapid solidification process, due to the solute trapping effect. Mg or other alkali and alkaline earth metals can lead to the formations of various intermetallics in HEAs prepared by conventional casting, but could be dissolved into solid solutions by non-equilibrium processes such as mechanical alloying. It is proposed that non-equilibrium processes may be an effective way to introduce light elements Si, alkali and alkaline earth metals into HEAs.},

abstract = {A constitutive approach is developed that predicts the critical stress for twinning as a function of external (temperature, strain rate) and internal (grain size, stacking-fault energy) parameters. Plastic deformation by slip and twinning are considered as competitive mechanisms. The twinning stress is equated to the slip stress based on the plastic flow by thermally assisted movement of dislocations over obstacles, which leads to successful prediction of the slip-twinning transition. The model is applied to body centered cubic, face centered cubic, and hexagonal metals and alloys: Fe, Cu, brasses, and Ti, respectively. A constitutive expression for the twinning stress in BCC metals is developed using dislocation emission from a source and the formation of pile-ups, as rate-controlling mechanism. Employing an Eshelby-type analysis, the critical size of twin nucleus and twinning stress are correlated to the twin-boundary energy, which is directly related to the stacking-fault energy (SFE) for FCC metals. The effects of grain size and SFE are examined and the results indicate that the grain-scale pile-ups are not the source of the stress concentrations giving rise to twinning in FCC metals. The constitutive description of the slip-twinning transition are incorporated into the Weertman-Ashby deformation mechanism maps, thereby enabling the introduction of a twinning domain. This is illustrated for titanium with a grain size of 100 $\mu$m. {\textcopyright} 2001 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1-In t r o d u c t io n. A n a l o g y to F errom agnetism In a recent paper, Bragg and Williams* have pointed out that the arrangement of the atoms in an alloy depends in a striking way on the temperature. At high temperatures, the atoms are distributed practically at random among the lattice points of the crystal, but at low temperatures a superlattice may be formed such that the atoms of one kind are arranged in a regular lattice of their own and the atoms of the other kind occupy the remaining " sites " in the crystal. The transition from the ordered to the disordered state occurs in a fairly small temperature range, and is accompanied by a large specific heat, an increase in electric resistance, etc. The mathematical method employed by Bragg and Williams is similar to that used in Weiss's theory of ferromagnetism. Both involve the assumption that the " force " tending to produce order at a given point is uniquely determined by the average state of order throughout the crystal. Actually it will depend on the configuration of the atoms in the immediate neighbourhood of the point under consideration. The order of the crystal as a whole determines this configuration only on the average. In the present paper, the effect of fluctuations in configuration, which was neglected by Bragg and Williams, will be taken into account. For our investigation, we shall assume that only nearest neighbours interact. This assumption is essentially the same as that which underlies the modern theory of ferromagnetism, f There we have an interaction energy (electron exchange) between the spins of neighbouring atoms which tries to set them parallel. This interaction, although only acting between neighbouring spins, is nevertheless capable of setting all spins throughout the crystal parallel at low temperatures, thus establishing perfect order. In addition, experimentally a sharp Curie point is found at which the " order," i.e., the permanent moment, of the crystal as a whole dis­},

abstract = {Metals have been mankind's most essential materials for thousands of years; however, their use is affected by ecological and economical concerns. Alloys with higher strength and ductility could alleviate some of these concerns by reducing weight and improving energy efficiency. However, most metallurgical mechanisms for increasing strength lead to ductility loss, an effect referred to as the strength-ductility trade-off. Here we present a metastability-engineering strategy in which we design nanostructured, bulk high-entropy alloys with multiple compositionally equivalent high-entropy phases. High-entropy alloys were originally proposed to benefit from phase stabilization through entropy maximization. Yet here, motivated by recent work that relaxes the strict restrictions on high-entropy alloy compositions by demonstrating the weakness of this connection, the concept is overturned. We decrease phase stability to achieve two key benefits: interface hardening due to a dual-phase microstructure (resulting from reduced thermal stability of the high-temperature phase); and transformation-induced hardening (resulting from the reduced mechanical stability of the room-temperature phase). This combines the best of two worlds: extensive hardening due to the decreased phase stability known from advanced steels and massive solid-solution strengthening of high-entropy alloys. In our transformation-induced plasticity-assisted, dual-phase high-entropy alloy (TRIP-DP-HEA), these two contributions lead respectively to enhanced trans-grain and inter-grain slip resistance, and hence, increased strength. Moreover, the increased strain hardening capacity that is enabled by dislocation hardening of the stable phase and transformation-induced hardening of the metastable phase produces increased ductility. This combined increase in strength and ductility distinguishes the TRIP-DP-HEA alloy from other recently developed structural materials. This metastability-engineering strategy should thus usefully guide design in the near-infinite compositional space of high-entropy alloys.},

This represents the first successful attempt to cold roll a HEA with a BCC crystal structure. The microstructure and properties of the rolled sheets were determined in the as-rolled condition and after annealing at 800 C, 1000 C, and 1200 C. Cold rolling resulted in extensive grain elongation, formation of deformation bands within the grains, and development of crystallographic textures that depended on the rolling reduction. The 86.4{\%} cold-rolled sheet had true tensile stress of 1295 MPa and tensile ductility of 4.7{\%}. After annealing at 1000 C and 1200 C, complete recrystallization of the cold-rolled sheet occurred. After annealing at 1000 C, the true tensile stress and ductility of the sheet were 1262 MPa and 9.7{\%}, respectively.},

Positive strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) on the yielding strength is available, and the work-hardening is weakened but the yielding strength is improved with increasing strain rates due to the adiabatic heating upon dynamic loadings and the dislocation movement resistance, respectively. Considering the adiabatic temperature rise converted by plastic deformation work at high strain rates, the flow behavior is characterized by employing the modified Johnson-Cook model.

The P-N barrier energy and a generalized fault energy, $\gamma$F, are combined and used as a measure of dislocation mobility. Furthermore, a fracture model has been developed to describe the process of thermally activated dislocations moving away from the crack tip and to predict the corresponding fracture resistance. A ductility index defined in terms of the ratio of $\gamma$s/(UP-N + $\gamma$F), where $\gamma$s is the surface energy, is used to correlate with the fracture toughness, KC, of individual intermetallics. The correlation indicates that fracture toughness increases with increasing values of $\gamma$s/(UP-N + $\gamma$F), in accordance with the fracture model formulated based on thermally activated slip. The use of the fracture model for predicting the effects of slip behavior, temperature, and alloy additions on fracture resistance is demonstrated for selected intermetallics including NiAl, TiAl, Laves phase, and Nb5Si3.},

abstract = {Hot-deformation behaviors of an equiatomic HfNbTaTiZr refractory high entropy alloy having BCC structure were investigated. Uniaxial compression was carried out at different temperatures ranging from 1000 °C to 1200 °C and various strain rates from 10 −4 s −1 to 10 −2 s −1 where BCC single phase was stable. Stress-strain curves indicated distinctive sharp drops at yielding followed by continuous decreases of flow stress. Interrupted compression tests indicated that the sharp drop of the stress was explained from a viewpoint of dislocation unlocking possibly by solute atom(s) atmosphere or short-range ordering. Flow stress analysis was carried out by using Arrhenius type power law relationship. The apparent activation energy (Q) for hot-deformation estimated from the flow stress data was 258–232 kJ mol −1 over the entire range of strain. The flow stress analysis indicated high strain rate sensitivity (m) of the flow stress (m ∼ 0.33). The relatively high m value and dynamically recrystallized (DRX) microstructures composed of coarse unrecrystallized regions and fine DRX grains with necklace morphologies indicated a possibility of grain boundary sliding (GBS) in the fine-grained DRX regions. The fine DRX grain sizes indicated inhibited grain growth after DRX, which might be due to sluggish diffusion in the HfNbTaTiZr alloy. Preferred orientations of {\textless}001{\textgreater} and {\textless}111{\textgreater} parallel to the compression axis in the unrecrystallized coarse regions indicated normal dislocation slips in the BCC crystal, while weak and near-random texture observed in the fine-grained DRX regions supported the occurrence of GBS.},

abstract = {Deformation twinning in crystals is one of the major strain carrier during plastic deformation, which plays a critical role in determining the mechanical properties of metals and alloys. One of the key issues to understand deformation twinning mechanisms is the determination of deformation path, which is critical for the calculations of twinning strain and critical shear stress. This work provides a new perspective on deformation twinning by systematically investigating the relationship between symmetry breaking and deformation path, with the purpose of establishing a theoretical foundation to identify the broken symmetries associated with twinning and predicting the twinning modes using group theory and graph theory. From a physical point of view, deformation twins can be regarded as one type of the so-called topological defects that are induced by symmetry-breaking. Taking BCC crystals as an example, we demonstrate how the presence of intermediate high symmetry states in the deformation strain space (strain calculated through lattice distortion) along the twinning path, such as FCC, HCP or orthorhombic state, can lead to different characteristic twinning modes. Our predictions not only agree well with classical theoretical analyses and experimental observations in BCC metals and alloys, but also reveal the origin of recently observed high-index twinning modes (such as {\{}5 8 11{\}} and {\{}3 9 10{\}} twins). This work may open a new avenue for analyzing deformation twinning through the symmetry breaking along twinning pathways.},

abstract = {Up to date, the electronic structure properties of amorphous lanthanum hexaboride, a-LaB6, were not yet investigated, and the thermodynamic and mechanical properties of crystalline lanthanum hexaboride (c-LaB6) were studied incompletely. The goal of this work was to fill these gaps in the study of lanthanum hexaborides. The electronic and phonon structures, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of both crystalline and amorphous lanthanum hexaborides (c-LaB6, a-LaB6, respectively) were investigated within the density functional theory. An amorphyzation of c-LaB6 gives rise to the metal – semiconductor transition. The thermal conductivity decreases on going from c-LaB6 to a-LaB6. The elastic moduli, hardness, ideal tensile and shear strengths of a-LaB6 are significantly lower compared to those of the crystalline counterpart, despite the formation of the icosahedron-like boron network in the amorphous phase. For c-LaB6, the stable boron octahedrons are preserved after the failure under tensile and shear strains. The peculiarity in the temperature dependence of heat capacity, Cp(T), at 50 K is explained by the availability of a sharp peak at 100 cm−1 in the phonon density of states of c-LaB6. An analysis of the Fermi surface indicates that this peak is not related to the shape of the Fermi surface, and is caused by the vibration of lanthanum atoms. In the phonon spectrum of a-LaB6, the peak at 100 cm−1 is significantly broader than in the spectrum of c-LaB6, for which reason the anomaly in the Cp(T) dependence of a-LaB6 does not appear. The calculated characteristics are in good agreement with the available experimental data.},

Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging and complex landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry, such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems.

We conducted quantitative statistical analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify the role of interstitial oxygen/nitrogen during the onset of plasticity. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were also performed to confirm that the oxygen/nitrogen atoms were indeed present as interstitial solutes. These interstitial solutes could increase the critical shear stress required to initiate plasticity, and nitrogen yielded a larger hardening effect than oxygen. The activation volumes were evaluated to be about 2–3 atomic volumes, indicating cooperative migration of multiple atoms during the dislocation nucleation, and neither oxygen nor nitrogen appeared to significantly affect this activation process. Hardness tests were also carried out and the result demonstrated that the enhancement of the critical shear stress for incipient plasticity was not caused by the traditional solid-solution strengthening mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that oxygen/nitrogen interstitials induced local charge transfer and improved the lattice cohesion, which was probably responsible for the enhanced pop-in load/stress in the current interstitially alloyed HEAs.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Analysis of creep data was based on the scaling factors of creep curves instead of the conventional extrapolated steady-state creep rate. Power-law creep equation is suggested to be the best for describing the primary transient creep behavior, because the pre-parameter does not apparently change with elapsed time. The observed anelastic strains are 1/6 of the calculated elastic strains, and linear viscous behavior was identified from the logarithm plot of the anelastic strain rate versus anelastic strain (slope equals 1). Therefore, the creep anelasticity is suggested to be due to the unbowing of there-dimensional network of dislocations.},

abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) are barely 12 years old. The field has stimulated new ideas and has inspired the exploration of the vast composition space offered by multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs). Here we present a critical review of this field, with the intent of summarizing key findings, uncovering major trends and providing guidance for future efforts. Major themes in this assessment include definition of terms; thermodynamic analysis of complex, concentrated alloys (CCAs); taxonomy of current alloy families; microstructures; mechanical properties; potential applications; and future efforts. Based on detailed analyses, the following major results emerge. Although classical thermodynamic concepts are unchanged, trends in MPEAs can be different than in simpler alloys. Common thermodynamic perceptions can be misleading and new trends are described. From a strong focus on 3d transition metal alloys, there are now seven distinct CCA families. A new theme of designing alloy families by selecting elements to achieve a specific, intended purpose is starting to emerge. A comprehensive microstructural assessment is performed using three datasets: experimental data drawn from 408 different alloys and two computational datasets generated using the CALculated PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method. Each dataset emphasizes different elements and shows different microstructural trends. Trends in these three datasets are all predicted by a ‘structure in – structure out' (SISO) analysis developed here that uses the weighted fractions of the constituent element crystal structures in each dataset. A total of 13 distinct multi-principal element single-phase fields are found in this microstructural assessment. Relationships between composition, microstructure and properties are established for 3d transition metal MPEAs, including the roles of Al, Cr and Cu. Critical evaluation shows that commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys with 3 or more principal elements are MPEAs, as well as some established functional materials. Mechanical properties of 3d transition metal CCAs are equivalent to commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys, while some refractory metal CCAs show potential to extend the service strength and/or temperature of nickel superalloys. Detailed analyses of microstructures and properties allow two major HEA hypotheses to be resolved. Although the ‘entropy effect' is not supported by the present data, it has nevertheless made an enduring contribution by inspiring a clearer understanding of the importance of configurational entropy on phase stability. The ‘sluggish diffusion' hypothesis is also not supported by available data, but it motivates re-evaluation of a classical concept of metallic diffusion. Building on recent published work, the CCA field has expanded to include materials with metallic, ionic or covalent bonding. It also includes microstructures with any number of phases and any type of phases. Finally, the MPEA field is shown to include both structural and functional materials applications. A significant number of future efforts are recommended, with an emphasis on developing high-throughput experiments and computations for structural materials. The review concludes with a brief description of major accomplishments of the field and insights gained from the first 12 years of research. The field has lost none of its potency and continues to pose new questions and offer new possibilities. The vast range of complex compositions and microstructures remains the most compelling motivation for future studies.},

We predict the paramagnetic fcc phase to be most stable above room temperature in agreement with experiment. The corresponding thermal expansion and bulk modulus agree likewise well with experimental measurements. A careful analysis of the underlying entropy contributions allows us to identify that the originally postulated dominance of the configurational entropy is questionable.

abstract = {This paper attempts to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of the brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in textured, pre-deformed, polycrystalline body-centred cubic metals. For this purpose, five tungsten sheets have been rolled out from one and the same sintered ingot representing degrees of deformation of 1.8, 2.5, 3.0, 3.4, and 4.1 (logarithmic notation). Electron backscatter diffraction measurements display the evolution of the microstructure with increasing degree of deformation. The mean grain size of the five sheets in the normal direction is 1.1, 0.59, 0.48, 0.37, and 0.3 $\mu$m. Toughness tests based on the K-concept have been performed and the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature of the five sheets has been determined. The crack system used was the L-T crack system. The results have been benchmarked against the BDT temperature of a sintered ingot. The results show a decrease of the BDT temperature with increasing degree of deformation starting from 600 °C (873 K) for the sintered ingot via 115 °C (388 K), 85 °C (358 K), 75 °C (348 K), 60 °C (333K) down to − 65 °C (208 K) for the most heavily deformed tungsten plate. The results are discussed against the background of (i) rolling induced lattice defects such as (i-a) vacancies, (i-b) dislocations (i-c) grain boundaries, (ii) crystallographic texture, (iii) the state of stress, (iv) impurities, (v) sinter pores, and (vi) the geometrical arrangement of areas with low and high fracture toughness. The authors postulate that the BDT is still controlled by the kink-pair nucleation process of a screw dislocation and that the BDT temperature scales with the spacing of dislocation sources (e.g. grain boundary ledges, low angle boundaries, debris loops) along the crack front.},

abstract = {This article reviews the recent work on the high-entropy alloys (HEAs) in our group and others. HEAs usually contain five or more elements, and thus, the phase diagram of HEAs is often not available to be used to design the alloys. We have proposed that the parameters of $\delta$ and $\Omega$ can be used to predict the phase formation of HEAs, namely $\Omega$ ≥ 1.1 and $\delta$ ≤ 6.6{\%}, which are required to form solid-solution phases. To test this criterion, alloys of TiZrNbMoV x and CoCr FeNiAlNb x were prepared. Their microstructures mainly consist of simple bodycentered cubic solid solutions at low Nb contents. TiZrNbMoV x alloys possess excellent mechanical properties. Bridgman solidification was also used to control the microstructure of the CoCrFeNiAl alloy, and its plasticity was improved tobe about 30{\%}. Toour surprise, the CoCrFeNiAl HEAs exhibit no apparent ductile-to-brittle transition even when the temperatures are lowered from 298 K to 77 K. {\textcopyright} 2012 TMS.},

abstract = {The various assumptions implicit in the Peierls-Nabarro treatment of the core of an edge dislocation are critically reviewed. It is pointed out that the lattice barrier for dislocation motion, for the case where atom rows alternate along the slip plane, has twice the period and a much higher amplitude than for the case usually considered, where the atoms face each other across the slip plane. The resolution of this and other difficulties can be accomplished by arranging that the stress across the slip plane and its associated interaction potential be functions of the final, rather than the initial, position of each atom row. With this modification the lattice barrier has in every case the periodicity of the slip distance but the argument of the exponential factor controlling the height of the barrier is halved. The physical implication of this last result must await a more detailed treatment of the dislocation core than has been previously attempted.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Medium and high entropy alloys (MEAs and HEAs) based on 3d transition metals, such as face-centered cubic (fcc) CrCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi alloys, reveal remarkable mechanical properties. The stacking fault energy (SFE) is one of the key ingredients that controls the underlying deformation mechanism and hence the mechanical performance of materials. Previous experiments and simulations have therefore been devoted to determining the SFEs of various MEAs and HEAs. The impact of local chemical environment in the vicinity of the stacking faults is, however, still not fully understood. In this work, we investigate the impact of the compositional fluctuations in the vicinity of stacking faults for two prototype fcc MEAs and HEAs, namely CrCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi by employing first-principles calculations. Depending on the chemical composition close to the stacking fault, the intrinsic SFEs vary in the range of more than 150 mJ/m 2 for both the alloys, which indicates the presence of a strong driving force to promote particular types of chemical segregations towards the intrinsic stacking faults in MEAs and HEAs. Furthermore, the dependence of the intrinsic SFEs on local chemical fluctuations reveals a highly non-linear behavior, resulting in a non-trivial interplay of local chemical fluctuations and SFEs. This sheds new light on the importance of controlling chemical fluctuations via tuning, e.g., the annealing condition to obtain the desired mechanical properties for MEAs and HEAs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Three different special quasirandom structures (SQS's) of the substitutional hcp A1-x Bx binary random solutions (x=0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) are presented. These structures are able to mimic the most important pair and multi-site correlation functions corresponding to perfectly random hcp solutions at those compositions. Due to the relatively small size of the generated structures, they can be used to calculate the properties of random hcp alloys via first-principles methods. The structures are relaxed in order to find their lowest energy configurations at each composition. In some cases, it was found that full relaxation resulted in complete loss of their parental symmetry as hcp so geometry optimizations in which no local relaxations are allowed were also performed. In general, the first-principles results for the seven binary systems (Cd-Mg, Mg-Zr, Al-Mg, Mo-Ru, Hf-Ti, Hf-Zr, and Ti-Zr) show good agreement with both formation enthalpy and lattice parameters measurements from experiments. It is concluded that the SQS's presented in this work can be widely used to study the behavior of random hcp solutions. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Random body-centered-cubic (BCC) “High Entropy” alloys are a new class of alloys, some having high strength and good ductility at room temperature and some having exceptional high-temperature strength. There are no theories of strengthening of screw dislocations in BCC metals that span naturally from the dilute limit to the multi-component, non-dilute concentrations typical of the high-entropy domain. Here, such a theory is developed and validated. Unlike low-temperature elemental BCC metals and very dilute BCC alloys, strength is not controlled by the kink-pair nucleation mechanism. Rather, screw dislocations naturally adopt a kinked structure as the minimum total energy configuration in the field of random alloying atoms. The characteristic length and energy scales for the low-energy kinked screw dislocation are derived for random alloys, leading to a characteristic spacing of both kinks and cross-kinks that depends on the kink formation energy and a characteristic collective solute/screw dislocation interaction energy parameter. Glide motion of this initially-kinked screw dislocation occurs via Peierls-type motion, lateral kink glide, and failure of cross-kinks. All these features are observed in molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting strength versus temperature, strain rate, and composition is analytic. The theory is validated by comparison to experiments on non-dilute Fe-Si, Nb-Mo, Nb-W, and Ti-Nb-Zr-based high entropy alloys versus composition and temperature. The theory provides a framework for tailored design of new high-performance BCC alloys.},

abstract = {The generalized stacking fault energies (GSFE) and Peierls stresses are strongly related to the mechanical properties of refractory metals. In this work, the GSFE curves and Peierls stresses of screw and edge dislocations in four body-centered cubic refractory metals (Mo, Nb, Ta, and W) on the {\{}110{\}}, {\{}112{\}}, and {\{}123{\}} slip planes are calculated using molecular statics simulations. A recently developed machine learning (ML)-based interatomic potential, called the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP), is employed in all simulations. The computed GSFE curves achieve reasonable agreement with those from ab initio calculations and predict the asymmetry with respect to sense of glide direction on the {\{}112{\}} and {\{}123{\}} planes better than non-ML interatomic potentials. In general, SNAP provides screw dislocation Peierls stresses close to those of density functional theory, closer than those achieved by non-ML potentials. The screw dislocation Peierls stress values confirm slip symmetry on the {\{}110{\}} plane and exhibit pronounced slip asymmetry on the {\{}112{\}} and {\{}123{\}} planes. For all metals, the edge dislocation Peierls stress are the lowest on the {\{}110{\}} plane and the highest on the {\{}112{\}} plane.

A comprehensive review of experimental data for HEE index is given, which is a useful concept to qualitatively evaluate the severity of hydrogen embrittlement prior to performing detailed material and fracture analysis for a specific hydrogen environment application. High pressure and temperature effects of hydrogen gas on superalloy properties such as tensile ductility, fracture, low cycle and high cycle fatigue, cyclic crack growth rate, and creep stress rupture have been analyzed with respect to the behavior trends established from the HEE index values.

abstract = {Peierls stresses ($\tau$ P) of dislocations of 66 slip systems in 52 crystals were estimated from experimental data either by direct extrapolation of the critical resolved shear stress ($\tau$ c) vs. temperature curve to absolute zero temperature, or from the T 0 value at which the temperature dependence of $\tau$ c vanishes, based on the kink-pair formation enthalpy, which is a function of $\tau$ P, described by the line tension model of the dislocation. The normalized $\tau$ P/G (G is the shear modulus) values are distributed over four orders of magnitude, but $\tau$ P/G values for a group of crystals with the same crystal structure are within an order of magnitude, indicating a homologous nature of $\tau$ P in crystals. In order to compare the results with the Peierls-Nabarro (P-N) formula generalized to any dislocation character, log($\tau$ P/G) values were correlated with crystal parameters. In this generalized P-N plot, most of the plots deviate downwards from the Huntington relation (a revised, original P-N relation) and the results of the discretized P-N models of Ohsawa et al. (Ohsawa K, Koizumi H, Kirchner HOK, Suzuki T.

In the plot, there is a tendency that the stronger the covalent character, the higher the $\tau$ P/G value, reflecting the general tendency of the normalized theoretical shear strength of crystals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

The density of the AlNbTiVZrx alloys varied from 5590 kg m−3 for the AlNbTiV alloy to 5870 kg m−3 for the AlNbTiVZr1.5 alloy. The compression yield strength at 22 °C increased with an increase in the Zr content from 1000 MPa for the AlNbTiV alloy to 1535 MPa for the AlNbTiVZr1.5 alloy. The plasticity raised from 6{\%} for the AlNbTiV alloy to {\textgreater}50{\%} for the AlNbTiVZr0.5 alloy and then dropped to 0.4{\%} for the AlNbTiVZr1.5 alloy. At 600 °C, the strongest alloy was also the AlNbTiVZr1.5, whereas, at 800 °C, the AlNbTiVZr0.1 alloy demonstrated the maximum strength.

Moreover, the addition of Ru does not affect the site occupancy of other alloying elements.},

abstract = {Although metals strengthened by alloying have been used for millennia, models to quantify solid solution strengthening (SSS) were first proposed scarcely seventy years ago. Early models could predict the strengths of only simple alloys such as dilute binaries and not those of compositionally complex alloys because of the difficulty of calculating dislocation-solute interaction energies. Recently, models and theories of SSS have been proposed to tackle complex high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Here we show that the strength at 0 K of a prototypical HEA, CrMnFeCoNi, can be scaled and predicted using the root-mean-square atomic displacement, which can be deduced from X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations as the isotropic atomic displacement parameter, that is, the average displacements of the constituent atoms from regular lattice positions. We show that our approach can be applied successfully to rationalize SSS in FeCoNi, MnFeCoNi, MnCoNi, MnFeNi, CrCoNi, CrFeCoNi, and CrMnCoNi, which are all medium-entropy subsets of the CrMnFeCoNi HEA.},

The plastic deformation behavior of face centered cubic (FCC) metals and alloys is directly related to the SFE values. The several methods for determining SFE are critically discussed. The values reported in the 1960s and early 1970s are, in general, 20-30{\%} overestimated. The node dislocation method, due to Whelan, overestimates the SFE. The method based on the critical resolved shear stress is not reliable. The most accurate method is the direct observation of dissociated partials by weak beam in TEM or using HREM (High resolution electron microscopy). Indirect methods based in X-Ray Diffraction and texture may provide reasonable estimates since reliable SFE values of reference metals are available.

abstract = {The impressive mechanical properties of single phase BCC High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) has renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms controlling strength in BCC alloys. Theory and simulation of strengthening of screw dislocations in HEAs shows that screw dislocations become spontaneously kinked along their length to lower the total energy due to solute/screw interactions. Dislocation motion then mainly occurs via two mechanisms, lateral kink migration and breaking of cross-kinks due to kink formation on different glide planes. Existing kink migration models, in spite of successes in capturing some experiments, are based on several invalid assumptions. Here, a new theory for the kink migration in HEAs is developed based on recent understanding in dilute alloys, leading to a fully derived analytical model for the kink migration energy barrier as a function of applied stress and kink spacing. Results emerge to be quantitatively close to those presented in recent theory by Maresca and Curtin but are on much firmer theoretical basis. A revised version of the Maresca-Curtin screw strengthening theory that incorporates the new kink migration model is compared to experiments on non-dilute Fe-Si, Nb-Mo, and Nb-W alloys and shows broad agreement as a function of temperature and composition, establishing the quantitative accuracy of the new theory.},

Our analysis of SF energies (SFEs) derived from density functional theory calculations reveals that the SFEs are high, which suggests that the SF is not induced by external shear stress deformation but by lattice misfit between conjoined subgrains nucleated from the same austenite grain.},

abstract = {The temperature-driven fcc-to-bcc phase transition in calcium is examined by a fully ab initio-based integrated technique including all relevant finite-temperature excitation mechanisms. The approach is based on density-functional-theory calculations with a controlled numerical stability of below 0.5 meV/atom for the electronic, quasiharmonic, and structural excitations and better than 1 meV/atom for the explicitly anharmonic contribution. The latter is achieved by successfully utilizing the recently developed hierarchical upsampled thermodynamic integration using Langevin dynamics method. This approach gives direct access to a numerically highly precise volume- and temperature-dependent free-energy surface and derived properties. It enables us to assign the remaining deviations from experiment to inherent errors of the presently available exchange-correlation functionals. Performing the full analysis with both of the conventional functionals, local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation, we demonstrate that-when considered on an absolute scale-thermodynamic properties are dictated by a strikingly similar free energy vs volume curve. Further, we show that, despite an error in the T=0 K energy difference between the two phases (∼6 meV in the present case), an excellent agreement of the temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy difference with experimentally derived data is feasible. This makes it possible, for instance, to unveil unreliable and possibly erroneous experimental input used in popular thermodynamic databases as we explicitly demonstrate for the isobaric heat capacity of calcium. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Mechanical responses of tungsten (W) and its alloys are strongly controlled by the properties of 1/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocations. Rhenium (Re), as a typical alloying and transmutation element in W, can substantially modify the properties of the dislocations, thus the plasticity of the materials. In this study, we investigate the interaction of Re and Re clusters with the screw dislocations in W by first-principles calculations in combination with theoretical models. Specifically, we propose two competing and Re-distribution dependent mechanisms, i.e. “ductilizing effect” and “hardening effect”; both are crucial to the mechanical properties of W. For the ductilizing effect, dispersed Re atoms weaken the surrounding interatomic interaction and reduce the shear resistance, thus facilitating the motion of the dislocation. In contrast, for the hardening effect, Re clusters formed by aggregated Re atoms due to irradiation can increase the Peierls stress and energy, thus hindering the motion of the dislocations. The proposed mechanisms shed light on the experimental observations that there is a Re-induced transition from ductilizing to hardening due to irradiation. The current work provides a theoretical guidance to the development of W-based future fusion materials in search of ductilizing alloying elements.},

abstract = {In this paper, a method for measuring the SEM electron beam spot profile is reported: a thin (1im) film aperture is used as a knife-edge target, and scanned at high magnification. The derivative of the detected signal is proportional to the spot cross section width. High contrast is achieved at the edge of the aperture hole, because the hole boundary is well-defined and because the electron yield is zero inside the hole. Therefore, the measurement is independent of detection efficiency, electron collection and electron-material interaction. A non-zero spot size results in image blurring and reduced resolution. Knowledge of spot size and intensity distribution may be used, as in the Opal 783OSi, for countering this effect. Monitoring spot characteristics may also be used for diagnostic purposes, such as detecting astigmatism or misalignment},

abstract = {Deformation behavior of equiatomic HfNbTaTiZr high entropy alloy single crystals and polycrystals were investigated. The single crystalline specimens could be obtained from the coarse-grained polycrystals annealed just below the melting point. 1/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocations played an important role in the deformation behavior, similar to body centered cubic (bcc) metals. Moreover, a yield stress anomaly was found to appear in the alloys solutionized at 1473 K. The yield stress decreased rapidly with increasing temperature up to 673 K, while the stress increased at 873 K. Further increase in temperature resulted in a decrease in yield stress. It is also noted that the microstructure of the alloys depended strongly on annealing temperature. At 773–1073 K, phase separation into two bcc phase took place, while the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase was precipitated at 773–973 K. The $\omega$ phase which is typical in $\beta$-titanium alloys was also observed at 673 K. The strain-rate sensitivity of the deformation behavior and micro-Vickers hardness after the heat treatment suggest that the dynamic precipitation of the hcp phase is responsible for the yield stress anomaly.},

@article{Duesbery2012,
abstract = {The anisotropy of plasticity in b.c.c. metals is decomposed into two parts. The first, a variation of the Peierls stress with slip plane and sense of slip, is intrinsic to the b.c.c. structure and is reflected in the geometry of the screw dislocation core and of the generalized stacking fault energy (g) surface. The second part, a sensitivity of the Peierls stress to non-glide elements of the applied stress, is shown to be due to small edge fractional dislocation components in the screw dislocation core. These edge components and their change in response to non-glide applied stress can be explained by the characteristics of the g-surface. These concepts are illustrated by means of atomistic calculations, using Finnis-Sinclair interatomic force laws, for the b.c.c. transition elements of groups VB and VIB of the periodic table. Metals in the two groups are shown to fall into two classes of core structure and behavior; the contrasting properties can be explained in terms of the g-surfaces, and can be traced further to differences in the elastic constants.},

Densities and E are directly proportional to the VEC and liquidus temperature of the alloys. Ti, Zr, Hf are ductilizing the alloys and making them light; whereas Cr, Mo and W, are reducing the alloys' ductility and making them heavy. For quinary RHEAs, Cp shows six distinct groups with $\delta$, but a similar trend is not observed in quaternary RHEAs. A methodology is developed to screen a large number of alloys based on various properties. Correlations between those properties are also studied.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Microstructure and mechanical properties are key parameters influencing the performance of structural multi-phase alloys such as those based on intermetallic TiAl compounds. There, the main constituent, a $\gamma$-TiAl phase, is derived froma face-centered cubic structure. Consequently, the dissociation of dislocations and generation of stacking faults (SFs) are important factors contributing to the overall deformation behavior, as well as mechanical properties, such as tensile/creep strength and, most importantly, fracture elongation below the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature. In this work, SFs on the f111) plane in $\gamma$-TiAl are revisited by means of ab initio calculations, finding their energies in agreement with previous reports. Subsequently, stacking fault energies are evaluated for eight ternary additions, namely group IVB-VIB elements, together with Ti off-stoichiometry. It is found that the energies of superlattice intrinsic SFs, anti-phase boundaries (APBs), as well as complex SFs decrease by 20-40{\%} with respect to values in stoichiometric $\gamma$-TiAl once an alloying element X is present in the fault plane having thus a composition of Ti-50Al-12.5X. In addition,Mo, Ti and V stabilize the APB on the (111) plane, which is intrinsically unstable at 0K in stoichiometric $\gamma$-TiAl.},

abstract = {The deformation micro-mechanisms of an as-cast equimolar refractory high-entropy alloy composed of Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta are analyzed by monotonic and relaxation compression tests coupled to transmission electron microscopy observations. The evolution of the work hardening with plastic strain displays 3 stages. After a sharp decrease until a plastic strain of approximately 3{\%}, work hardening stabilizes at 1300±50MPa and finally decreases again. The measured apparent activation volumes Vapp* slightly evolve with plastic strain and decrease from approximately 50b3 to 30b3. These values are coherent with a Peierls mechanism due to strong intrinsic lattice friction. In addition, the measured activation volumes correlate well with TEM observations, which give evidence that dislocation glide is controlled - in the first stages - by the movement of screw dislocations. The deformation is rapidly localized in bands in which dislocation dipoles, loops and tangles are induced at higher plastic strains.},

abstract = {Face-centered cubic (fcc) HEAs, particularly the typical FeCoNiCrMn HEA, are promising for cryogenic applications but generally exhibit relatively low strength at ambient temperature, which limits their widespread uses. In this work, we present a systematic study of enhancing simultaneously the strength and ductility of FeCoNiCrMn HEAs via tailoring the phase stability and stacking fault energy (SFE). It was found that in Fe20CoxNi40-xCr20Mn20 (x = 20–30 at.{\%}) HEAs, with the increase of Co, the SFE was gradually decreased and another hcp (hexagonal close-packed) phase was eventually formed in the alloy containing 28 at.{\%} Co. As a result, the deformation mode changes from dislocation glide to mechanical twinning, then to $\gamma$fcc → $\epsilon$hcp martensitic transformation. Our analysis indicates that the small critical shear stress for twinning resulted from the reduced SFE provides a steady strain hardening rate in a wide strain regime and postpones the plastic instability, eventually leading to the concurrent enhancement in the tensile strength and ductility. Our results not only shed lights on understanding of the effects of SFE on the mechanical properties, but also have important implications on the development of HEAs with a unique combination of high strength and large ductility.},

abstract = {Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) are candidates for replacing conventional refractory alloys. In this work, twelve new RHEAs were selected and produced. The phases present in the as-cast and heat-treated conditions were characterized and compared with CALPHAD simulations and empirical parameters. Here we propose a new interpretation for the two widely used $\delta$ and $\Omega$ empirical parameters. In this work, they are shown to be inaccurate when applied to a large group of RHEAs, but can be a powerful alloy design tool if applied on specific subsystems of alloys. Experimentally, chromium-containing alloys are shown to form Laves phases, especially when the lattice distortion ($\delta$) is high, while aluminum-containing alloys are shown to form the A15 phase upon heat-treatment, due to their highly negative enthalpy of mixing ($\Delta$Hmix). In addition to microstructural characterization, mechanical properties of these alloys via hardness testing were assessed. A poor correlation was observed between the hardness and the atomic size and elastic modulus mismatch in these single-phase BCC RHEAs, suggesting that core structure of the screw dislocations is a crucial parameter in understanding the strength of these alloys.},

Ruthenium and rhenium were found to degrade the oxidation resistance by the vaporization oftheir oxide. Tantalum-rich oxide in the spinel layer acts to stabilize ruthenium and rhenium oxide in the scale.

abstract = {Current alloy development efforts in High Entropy Alloys call for a better understanding of solution hardening in high-concentration chemically-complex alloys. Here we propose a general scheme for assessing the overall solute-dislocation interaction, independent of concentration, stress, and temperature. While significant progress has been made in including solute-dislocation interactions in FCC metals (Leyson et al) there are open questions as to how to model more complex (solute-solute-dislocation) chemical interactions that arise in high concentration solid solutions. A method similar to Olmsted et al, is developed to quantify representative energy landscapes as a dislocation percolates through a field of solutes. This approach uses molecular dynamics under stress in order to estimate the strengthening parameters for a system over a wide range of solute concentrations and a moderate range of temperatures. While MD introduces additional complications to the simulation, due to coupling of temperature with the potential energy of the system, it also provides significant flexibility in terms of avoiding local minimum, assessing the effects of dislocation bowing and the effects of stress and temperature. Also, by avoiding the direct assessment of solute-solute bonding very complex systems can be evaluated efficiently. As proof of concept the method is applied to Al solutes in FCC Ni, where the system is known to be dominated by strong Al solute-solute interactions at high solute concentrations. Self-consistency of the method is shown by computing various strengthening parameters near critical percolation stress states at various system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures. We propose an extension to current solute-dislocation hardening models (i.e. Leyson et al.) to include solute-solute bonding and compare the scaling prediction and temperature dependence of solid solution models to the molecular dynamics results.},

A phenomenological correlation by Pugh between metal brittleness and its shear modulus to bulk modulus ratio was established more than 60 years ago. Nearly four decades later Pettifor conducted a quantum mechanical analysis of bond hybridization in a series of intermetallics and derived a separate ductility criterion based on the difference between two single-crystal elastic constants, C12–C44. In this paper, we discover the link between these two criteria and show that they are identical for materials with cubic crystal structures.},

abstract = {In this work, we calculate the local slip resistances (LSRs) in equal-molar MoNbTi multi-principal element alloy via molecular static simulations. We consider dislocations of either screw or edge character gliding on four types of slip planes, {\{}110{\}}, {\{}112{\}}, {\{}123{\}}, and {\{}134{\}}, in either forward or backward sense of the 111 slip direction. As references, we also compute the Peierls stresses of the same dislocations in two natural reference metals, Mo and Nb, and a synthetic one, the mean-field, A-atom potential-based MoNbTi. Further, we compare the LSRs with the corresponding ideal shear strengths that do not account for the lattice distortions induced by dislocation cores. We show that for neither dislocation character is the LSR on the {\{}110{\}} plane the lowest in MoNbTi, in contrast to Mo and Nb. For edge dislocations, slip on the {\{}134{\}} plane is the easiest, but for the screw dislocations, it is the hardest. For screw dislocations, the {\{}112{\}} glide plane is the most favored, while for edge dislocations, it is the least favored. We also find that the screw-to-edge ratio in the slip resistance is reduced by one order of magnitude in MoNbTi compared to that of any pure reference metal for the same type of slip plane. These results suggest that, in contrast to pure body-centered cubic (BCC) metals, BCC MPEAs could deform by a multiplicity of slip modes due to the lower screw-to-edge ratios and the lower LSRs for edge dislocations on the three higher order planes.},

abstract = {A new approach to the design of Ni-base polycrystalline superalloys is proposed. In this approach, we assume that the creep-rupture characteristics of a superalloy are mostly determined by the strength of interatomic bonding at grain boundaries (GBs) and in the bulk of $\gamma$ matrix. The ideal work of separation, Wsep, of a GB is used as a fundamental thermodynamic quantity that controls the mechanical strength of an interface, whereas the partial cohesive energy, $\chi$, of an alloy component serves to characterize its contribution into the strength of the bulk. Using the $\Sigma$5 (2 1 0)[1 0 0] symmetric tilt GB as a representative high-angle GB in Ni, we calculate Wsep,$\chi$, and GB segregation energies, Eseg, for the complete set of 4d and 5d transition metal impurities, to which we add B (a typical microalloying addition), S and Bi (notoriously known as harmful impurities in Ni-base superalloys). The purpose of the analysis is to identify the elements that demonstrate a high tendency to segregate to GBs, have positive (preferably high) partial cohesive energies in the bulk, and have positive impact on Wsep of GBs. We refer to these elements as low-alloying additions. Our study reveals Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta and B as the most promising low-alloying additions. Our next step is to introduce the elements found in the first step into a new powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-base superalloy. The results of the subsequent testing confirm that the newly created P/M superalloy indeed demonstrates superior mechanical properties at high temperatures compared to the existing Russian P/M alloy EP741NP.},

The obtained $\gamma$-surfaces for the same group of crystals are found to have similar shape and height when normalized by materials parameters, indicating homologous nature. Except for some very soft crystals ($\tau$Pexp/G ≪ 1 × 10−4), the calculated Peierls stresses for majority of crystals ($\tau$Pexp/G {\textgreater} 1 × 10−4) are shown, for the first time, to have a correlation with experimental ones reflecting the homologous nature of the $\gamma$-surface, although the former are generally larger than the latter by half an order on the average, with an exception of bcc metal in which the strain field of the controlling screw dislocation is known to be non-planar. For very soft crystals, the calculated Peierls stresses are orders of magnitude larger than experimental ones; possible origins of this large discrepancy are discussed.},

Yet, the yield strength values of medium- and high-entropy alloys investigated so far do not substantially exceed those of conventional alloys owing to the insufficient utilization of lattice distortion. Here it is shown that a simple VCoNi equiatomic medium-entropy alloy exhibits a near 1 GPa yield strength and good ductility, outperforming conventional solid-solution alloys. It is demonstrated that a wide fluctuation of the atomic bond distances in such alloys, i.e., severe lattice distortion, improves both yield stress and its sensitivity to grain size. In addition, the dislocation-mediated plasticity effectively enhances the strength–ductility relationship by generating nanosized dislocation substructures due to massive pinning. The results demonstrate that severe lattice distortion is a key property for identifying extra-strong materials for structural engineering applications.},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of data analytics tools for predicting the fatigue strength of steels. Several physics-based as well as data-driven approaches have been used to arrive at correlations between various properties of alloys and their compositions and manufacturing process parameters. Data-driven approaches are of significant interest to materials engineers especially in arriving at extreme value properties such as cyclic fatigue, where the current state-of-the-art physics based models have severe limitations. Unfortunately, there is limited amount of documented success in these efforts. In this paper, we explore the application of different data science techniques, including feature selection and predictive modeling, to the fatigue properties of steels, utilizing the data from the National Institute for Material Science (NIMS) public domain database, and present a systematic end-to-end framework for exploring materials informatics. Results demonstrate that several advanced data analytics techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and multivariate polynomial regression can achieve significant improvement in the prediction accuracy over previous efforts, with R2 values over 0.97. The results have successfully demonstrated the utility of such data mining tools for ranking the composition and process parameters in the order of their potential for predicting fatigue strength of steels, and actually develop predictive models for the same.},

However, there were few experimental evidences that directly observed the lattice distortion in HEAs. In this work, the experimental observation of lattice distortion in a new developed Fe33Mn13Co22Cr15Ni17 HEA by multiple tilting selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was reported. SAED observation of 51 zone axes were performed in a single grain of the HEA sample. Among them, 24 normal diffraction patterns and 27 anomalous diffraction patterns with extra diffraction spots around the normal reflection spots were observed. According to the proportional relationship between the extra diffraction spots and the normal ones, the extra diffraction spots could be indexed with three non-integral Miller indices. The anomalous diffraction patterns were considered as the effect of reciprocal space lattice distortion, resulting in a relrod extension on the order of half of the reciprocal space lattice constant. The existence of numerous extended reciprocal relrod suggested that serious lattice distortion occurred in concerned HEA, and it significantly affected the transformation from direct lattice to reciprocal lattice.},

In the initial condition (annealing at 1200 °C for 24 h), the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys were composed of the B2 phase while the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys had a mixture of the B2 and Cr2Nb-type C14 Laves phases. The AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0.5–1.5) alloys in the initial condition consisted of the B2, Zr5Al3-type, and ZrAlV-type C14 Laves phases. Annealing of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0–1.5) alloys at 800 °C or 1000 °C resulted in (i) precipitation of the Nb2Al-type $\sigma$-phase or an increase in the fraction of the Laves phase; (ii) an increase in the microhardness and a pronounced drop in ductility. Annealings of the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0.5–1.5) alloys at 800 °C or 1000 °C led to insignificant changes in the structure and microhardness but somewhat decreased ductility.

abstract = {Transition metal elements, alloys, and intermetallic compounds often adopt the body centered cubic (bcc) and face centered cubic (fcc) structures. By comparing quantitative density functional with qualitative tight-binding calculations, we analyze the electronic factors which make the bcc and fcc structures energetically favorable. To do so, we develop a tight-binding function, $\Delta$Estar, a function that measures the energetic effects of transferring electrons within wave vector stars. This function allows one to connect distortions in solids to the Jahn-Teller effect in molecules and to provide an orbital perspective on structure determining deformations in alloys. We illustrate its use by considering first a two-dimensional square net. We then turn to three-dimensional fcc and bcc structures, and distortions of these. Using $\Delta$Estar, we rationalize the differences in energy of these structures. We are able to deduce which orbitals are responsible for instabilities in seven to nine valence electron per atom (e-/a) bcc systems and five and six e-/a fcc structures. Finally we demonstrate that these results account for the bcc and fcc type structures found in both the elements and binary intermetallic compounds of group 4 through 9 transition metal atoms. The outline of a theory of metal structure deformations based on loss of point group operation rather than translational symmetry is presented.},

abstract = {This Viewpoint article articulates ten unusual features associated with dislocations and their slip processes in high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Attention will be directed towards the composition undulation almost inevitable in these highly concentrated solutions, even when the alloy is a single-phase and nominally random solution. This inhomogeneity is often exacerbated by lattice distortion and local chemical order arising from the interaction among multiple principal elements. As a consequence, dislocation motion faces a rugged atomic and energy landscape, presenting new twists in defect energetics and properties, as well as cocktail strengthening as a new form of solid solution hardening beyond the conventional mechanism. Our systematic account from this standpoint may help answer the continual query in the community as to what is special about these HEAs that makes them different from traditional solid solutions.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys constitute a new class of materials whose very existence poses fundamental questions regarding the physical principles underlying their unusual phase stability. Originally thought to be stabilized by the large entropy of mixing associated with their large number of components (five or more), these alloys have attracted attention for their potential applications. Yet, no model capable of robustly predicting which combinations of elements will form a single phase currently exists. Here, we propose a model that, through the use of high-throughput computation of the enthalpies of formation of binary compounds, predicts specific combinations of elements most likely to form single-phase, highentropy alloys. The model correctly identifies all known single-phase alloys while rejecting similar elemental combinations that are known to form an alloy comprising multiple phases. In addition, we predict numerous potential single-phase alloy compositions and provide three tables with the ten most likely five-, six-, and seven-component single-phase alloys to guide experimental searches.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm to generate Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS), i.e., best periodic supercell approximations to the true disordered state for a given number of atoms per supercell. The method is based on a Monte Carlo simulated annealing loop with an objective function that seeks to perfectly match the maximum number of correlation functions (as opposed to merely minimizing the distance between the SQS correlation and the disordered state correlations for a pre-specified set of correlations). The proposed method optimizes the shape of the supercell jointly with the occupation of the atomic sites, thus ensuring that the configurational space searched is exhaustive and not biased by a pre-specified supercell shape. The method has been implemented in the "mcsqs" code of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) in the most general framework of multicomponent multisublattice systems and in a way that minimizes the amount of input information the user needs to specify and that allows for efficient parallelization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thus, even at room temperature, the steel can become brittle and prone to cracking. In the present investigation, to elucidate the influence of low temperature on the DBTT, Charpy toughness test was performed on creep strength enhanced ferritic P91 and P92 steel. Lower DBTT was observed for the P92 steel as compared to P91 steel. To find the mode of fracture, the fractured Charpy toughness specimens were investigated using a field electron scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The fracture surface revealed the brittle mode of fracture at a lower temperature for both the steels while the mixed mode of fracture was noticed at room temperature and above.},

One exception is the HfNbTaTiZr alloy, which has a plasticity of over 50{\%} at room temperature. However, the strength of HfNbTaTiZr at high temperature is insufficient. In this study, the composition of HfNbTaTiZr is modified with an aim to improve its strength at high temperature, while retaining reasonable toughness at room temperature. Two new alloys with simple BCC structure, HfMoTaTiZr and HfMoNbTaTiZr, were designed and synthesized. The results show that the yield strengths of the new alloys are apparently higher than that of HfNbTaTiZr. Moreover, a fracture strain of 12{\%} is successfully retained in the HfMoNbTaTiZr alloy at room temperature.},

@article{Bethe1997,
abstract = {1— In t r o d u c t io n . A n a l o g y to F errom agnetism In a recent paper, Bragg and Williams* have pointed out that the arrangement of the atoms in an alloy depends in a striking way on the temperature. At high temperatures, the atoms are distributed practically at random among the lattice points of the crystal, but at low temperatures a superlattice may be formed such that the atoms of one kind are arranged in a regular lattice of their own and the atoms of the other kind occupy the remaining " sites " in the crystal. The transition from the ordered to the disordered state occurs in a fairly small temperature range, and is accompanied by a large specific heat, an increase in electric resistance, etc. The mathematical method employed by Bragg and Williams is similar to that used in Weiss's theory of ferromagnetism. Both involve the assumption that the " force " tending to produce order at a given point is uniquely determined by the average state of order throughout the crystal. Actually it will depend on the configuration of the atoms in the immediate neighbourhood of the point under consideration. The order of the crystal as a whole determines this configuration only on the average. In the present paper, the effect of fluctuations in configuration, which was neglected by Bragg and Williams, will be taken into account. For our investigation, we shall assume that only nearest neighbours interact. This assumption is essentially the same as that which underlies the modern theory of ferromagnetism, f There we have an interaction energy (electron exchange) between the spins of neighbouring atoms which tries to set them parallel. This interaction, although only acting between neighbouring spins, is nevertheless capable of setting all spins throughout the crystal parallel at low temperatures, thus establishing perfect order. In addition, experimentally a sharp Curie point is found at which the " order, " i.e., the permanent moment, of the crystal as a whole dis­ * 4 Proc. Roy.

abstract = {Today's gas turbine engines utilize high volume fraction gamma prime ($\gamma$′) strengthened alloys for turbine airfoils, which typically operate at temperatures greater than ∼0.5 Tmof the alloy. At these temperatures and at stresses below yield, time-dependent deformation (creep) of the airfoil can occur and, if left unabated, can result in complete separation of the airfoil. This process is commonly referred to as stress rupture. Insufficient cooling air, unintentional interruptions of cooling air as well as abnormal engine operating conditions are typical causes of stress-rupture failures in gas turbine blade components. Stress-rupture fractures are generally heavily oxidized, tend to be rough in texture, and are primarily intergranular and/or interdendritic in appearance compared to smoother, transgranular fatigue type fractures. Often, gross plastic yielding is visible on a macroscopic scale. Commonly observed microstructural characteristics include creep voiding along grain boundaries and/or interdendritic regions. Internal voids can also nucleate at carbides and other microconstituents, especially in single crystal castings that do not possess grain boundaries. Other signs of overtemperature include partial resolutioning of the $\gamma$′ strengthening precipitates, with the remaining volume fraction of $\gamma$′ commonly used to estimate blade metal temperatures. This article highlights the visual, fractographic, and metallographic characteristics typically encountered when analyzing stress rupture of turbine airfoils. {\textcopyright} ASM International 2008.},

In the bulk alloy, we observe clear ordering of mainly Mo--Ta and V--W binaries at low temperatures. In damaged crystals, our simulations reveal clear segregation of vanadium, the smallest atom in the alloy, to compressed interstitial-rich regions like radiation-induced dislocation loops. Vanadium also dominates the population of single self-interstitial atoms. In contrast, due to its larger size and low surface energy, niobium segregates to spacious regions like the inner surfaces of voids. When annealing samples with supersaturated concentrations of defects, we find that in complete contrast to W, interstitial atoms in MoNbTaVW cluster to create only small ({\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} nm) experimentally invisible dislocation loops enriched by vanadium. By comparison to W, we explain this by the reduced but three-dimensional migration of interstitials, the immobility of dislocation loops, and the increased mobility of vacancies in the high-entropy alloy, which together promote defect recombination over clustering.},

abstract = {Stacking fault energy (SFE) plays an important role in deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals and alloys. In metastable fcc alloys, the SFEs determined from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental methods often have opposite signs. Here, we show that the negative SFE by DFT reflects the thermodynamic instability of the fcc phase relative to the hexagonal close-packed one; while the experimentally determined SFEs are restricted to be positive by the models behind the indirect measurements. We argue that the common models underlying the experimental measurements of SFE fail in metastable alloys. In various concentrated solid solutions, we demonstrate that the SFEs obtained by DFT calculations correlate well with the primary deformation mechanisms observed experimentally, showing a better resolution than the experimentally measured SFEs. Furthermore, we believe that the negative SFE is important for understanding the abnormal behaviors of partial dislocations in metastable alloys under deformation. The present work advances the fundamental understanding of SFE and its relation to plastic deformations, and sheds light on future alloy design by physical metallurgy.},

The conventional approach to alloy design is to select one principal element and add elements to it in minor quantities in order to improve the properties. In 2004, Professor J.W. Yeh and his group first reported a new approach to alloy design, which involved mixing elements in equiatomic or near-equiatomic proportions, to form multi-component alloys with no single principal element. These alloys are expected to have high configurational entropy and hence were termed as ""high ent. Ch. 1. A Brief History of Alloys and the Birth of High-Entropy Alloys -- Ch. 2.

The study shows that the defect moves via the formation of four successive structural configurations in two adjacent regions at its front. Local decrease of atomic volume gives rise to the formation of intermediate structural configuration with bcc symmetry in one of the regions, while an increase of volume in other region leads to the formation of configuration with 13 nearest neighbors. Such intermediate configurations occur with an increase in the potential energy. The atomic volume and the potential energy take their initial values during final rearrangements which move the stacking fault on one elementary step.},

abstract = {An optimal integration of modern computational tools and efficient experimentation is presented for the accelerated design of Nb-based superalloys. Integrated within a systems engineering framework, we have used ab initio methods along with alloy theory tools to predict phase stability of solid solutions and intermetallics to accelerate assessment of thermodynamic and kinetic databases enabling comprehensive predictive design of multicomponent multiphase microstructures as dynamic systems. Such an approach is also applicable for the accelerated design and development of other high performance materials. Based on established principles underlying Ni-based superalloys, the central microstructural concept is a precipitation strengthened system in which coherent cubic aluminide phase(s) provide both creep strengthening and a source of Al for Al2O3 passivation enabled by a Nb-based alloy matrix with required ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, atomic transport kinetics and oxygen solubility behaviors. Ultrasoft and PAW pseudopotentials, as implemented in VASP, are used to calculate total energy, density of states and bonding charge densities of aluminides with B2 and L21 structures relevant to this research. Characterization of prototype alloys by transmission and analytical electron microscopy demonstrates the precipitation of B2 or L21 aluminide in a (Nb) matrix. Employing Thermo-Calc and DICTRA software systems, thermodynamic and kinetic databases are developed for substitutional alloying elements and interstitial oxygen to enhance the diffusivity ratio of Al to O for promotion of Al2O3 passivation. However, the oxidation study of a Nb-Hf-Al alloy, with enhanced solubility of Al in (Nb) than in binary Nb-Al alloys, at 1300 °C shows the presence of a mixed oxide layer of NbAlO4 and HfO2 exhibiting parabolic growth. {\textcopyright} 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {The body centered cubic (BCC) high entropy alloys (HEAs) MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW show exceptional strength retention up to 1900K. The mechanistic origin of the retained strength is unknown yet is crucial for finding the best alloys across the immense space of BCC HEA compositions. Experiments on Nb-Mo, Fe-Si and Ti-Zr-Nb alloys report decreased mobility of edge dislocations, motivating a theory of strengthening of edge dislocations in BCC alloys. The strength of BCC HEAs can be controlled by edge dislocations, especially at high temperatures, because the random field of solutes in these high-concentration alloys creates large energy barriers for thermally-activated edge glide. A parameter-free theory for this mechanism of edge motion in BCC alloys qualitatively and quantitatively captures the strength versus temperature for both MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW alloys and other BCC HEAs. A reduced analytic version of the theory, embodying the edge-strengthening mechanism, then enables screening over {\textgreater} 600,000 compositions in the Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W family to identify promising new compositions with high retained strength and/or reduced mass density. Overall, the theory reveals an unexpected mechanism - edge dislocation motion in the random alloy - as responsible for high temperature strength in BCC alloys and paves the way for theory-guided design of new high-performance HEAs.},

abstract = {Short-range order (SRO) strengthening is one of the major strengthening mechanisms in alloys. Generally it is attributed to the increased resistance to dislocation slip caused by breaking favorable bonds. This contribution may be strong for the first dislocation slipping in a slip plane, but it is certainly less strong for the following next dislocations. Present work discusses SRO strengthening with a different optic: with the focus on the dissipated energy due to the formation of a diffuse antiphase boundary (APB). In this sense, SRO strengthening becomes important to define the friction stress on gliding dislocations. Cluster Variation Method calculations of APB energies are used to estimate the strengthening effect in BCC alloys. The results are illustrated using VNbTaMoW and VNbTaWAl high-entropy alloys, with ab-initio derived parameters. The results show that the strengthening is intense in the range of concentrated solid solutions, and also, that this effect is strongly composition-dependent.},

The data were shown to fit a diffusion/trapping model under interface control, and values were determined for the irreversible trapping constants (k) and the flux of hydrogen into the alloys. The density of irreversible trap defects in Inconel 718 and Incoloy 925 was calculated from k and found to be in excellent agreement with the concentration of NbTi(CN) and TiC particles, respectively. The maraging steel was characterized by two trapping constants; one is associated with quasi-irreversible traps that saturate, leaving only irreversible traps thought to be TiC/Ti(CN) particles. The irreversible trapping constants for these alloys are consistent with their relative susceptibilities to hydrogen embrittlement. Moreover, a comparison of the trapping constants with those for AISI 4340 steel and two other nickel-base alloys (Monel K-500 and MP35N) indicates that a strong correlation exists between hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility and trapping capability over all the alloys. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {A method of interpreting radial distribution functions (RDF) of amorphous metals is proposed in which the role of the local atomic structure is emphasized. It is found that the width and height of the peaks of the RDF are related to the second moment of the atomic-level hydrostatic stress distribution p2. The results of this analysis are then used to explain the details of the changes that occur in the RDF when structural relaxation takes place. The theoretical RDF is found to be in excellent agreement with the results of a computer study and previous experimental results. It is further proposed that changes in p2 may be most easily accounted for in terms of changes in the density of the structural defects defined in terms of the local fluctuations in the hydrostatic stress. In this way the changes that occur in the structure of amorphous metal during structural relaxation, as represented by the RDF, may be explained in terms of the motion and annihilation of these structural defects. It is concluded that the number density of defects which could account for the observed changes in the experimental RDF is 10{\%}. It is also found that while the hydrostatic stress distribution may be significantly changed during structural relaxation, the distribution of the atomic-level shear stresses remains unaltered. {\textcopyright} 1981 The American Physical Society.},

According to the equilibrium phase diagram about 30 at.{\%} Re can go into a bcc W-Re solid solution. However, ab initio electronic structure calculations show that the bcc lattice becomes dynamically unstable at high Re concentrations. Through a detailed calculation of the phonon spectrum, we find that bcc W1-cRec does not become dynamically unstable until c≳0.7, i.e., well above the equilibrium solubility limit of Re in bcc W. Concentration fluctuations of Re in irradiated W will therefore not lead to any significant number of regions where the bcc lattice collapses due to a dynamical instability.},

abstract = {Alloy design is critical to achieving the target performance of industrial components and products. In designing new alloys, there are multiple property requirements, including mechanical, environmental, and physical properties, as well as manufacturability and processability. Computational models and tools to predict properties from alloy compositions and to optimize compositions for multiple objectives are essential in enabling efficient, robust alloy design. Data-driven property models by machine learning (ML) are particularly useful in predicting physical properties with relatively simple dependence on composition, and in predicting complex properties that are too difficult for a physics-based model to achieve with desirable accuracy. In this article, we describe examples of ML applications to model coefficient of thermal expansion, creep and fatigue resistance in designing Ni-based superalloys, and optimization methodologies. We also discuss physics-based microstructure models that have been developed for optimizing heat-treatment conditions to achieve desired microstructures.},

The beneficial influence of Ru with respect to this so called instability is nowadays well accepted. In the present paper the precipitation of topologically close packed (TCP) phases is studied quantitatively in two experimental alloys (one Ru-free and one with addition of Ru) to clarify the mechanism of the Ru effect. It is confirmed that the TCP phase precipitates undergo sequential phase transformation with the tetragonal $\sigma$-phase precipitating first. Ru retards the phase transformation and leads to decreased equilibrium volume fraction of TCP phases. The results clearly indicate that Ru decreases the driving force for TCP phase precipitation. Investigations of crystallography and chemistry of the TCP/matrix interface point to an additional effect by increase of misfit strain energy.},

abstract = {Mg-3wt.{\%}RE alloys show substantially enhanced 〈c+a〉 activity as compared to pure Mg or other Mg-Al, Mg-Zn alloys of similar grain sizes. Activation of 〈c+a〉 slip has been postulated to be associated with the reduction of the basal I1 stacking fault (SF) energy upon alloying with RE elements. However, the underlying mechanism and any special role of the RE solutes, as compared to Al and Zn, remain unclear. Here, precise first-principles methods and calculations are used to assess all relevant SF energies as a function of Y, Al and Zn concentrations in the dilute limit relevant to current experiments. Results show that solute effects vary among different solutes and among different SFs of the same solute. However, the effects of Y on basal plane SF energies can also be achieved by Al at similar/twice the concentrations and the effect of Y on the pyramidal (Pyr.) II plane can be achieved by Zn at similar concentrations. Enhanced 〈c+a〉 activity in Mg-3wt.{\%}RE alloys thus does not appear to be directly related to these SF energies, in contrast to current widely-accepted postulates. The average reductions in Pyr. II and I SF energies by Y also have little influence on the strong thermodynamic driving force for the transition of easy-glide Pyr. II and I dislocations into sessile basal-plane-dissociated structures. Y solutes only stand out in affecting the relative pyramidal SF energies differently than Al and Zn, which is not considered in any mechanisms proposed to date. These results highlight the importance of precise first-principles calculations in study of solid solution alloying at appropriate solute concentrations, which allows for the quantitative assessment of potential dislocation phenomena related to ductility.},

But if its inspiration was some- times international in flavor, its execution was American--from the early pre-X-15 studies of the 1950's through the pioneering missions of Columbia in 1981. Primarily, the hypersonic revolution grew out of the traditional federal-industrial partnership that had benefitted American aviation since the First World War. It germinated and flourished amidst the laboratories of the Air Force, Navy, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and its successor, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) , and the major aerospace manufacturers. Not merely an aerodynamic revolution, the hypersonic revolution--like the supersonic breakthrough and the drive for the "modern" airplane before it--involved the creative integration and exploitation of diverse technologies. 14.},

@article{George2020,
abstract = {The high-entropy alloy (HEA) concept was based on the idea that high mixing entropy can promote formation of stable single-phase microstructures. During the past 15 years, various alloy systems have been explored to identify HEA systems with improved property combinations, leading to an extraordinary growth of this field. In the large pool of alloys with varying characteristics, the first single-phase HEA with good tensile properties, the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi alloy has become the benchmark material, and it forms the basis of much of our current fundamental understanding of HEA mechanical behavior. As the field is evolving to the more broadly defined complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) and the available data in the literature increase exponentially, a fundamental question remains unchanged: how special are these new materials? In the first part of this review, select mechanical properties of HEAs and CCAs are compared with those of conventional engineering alloys. This task is difficult because of the limited tensile data available for HEAs and CCAs. Additionally, the wider suite of mechanical properties needed to assess structural materials is woefully lacking. Nonetheless, our evaluations have not revealed many HEAs or CCAs with properties far exceeding those of conventional engineering alloys, although specific alloys can show notable enhancements in specific properties. Consequently, it is reasonable to first approach the understanding of HEAs and CCAs through the assessment of how the well-established deformation mechanisms in conventional alloys operate or are modified in the presence of the high local complexity of the HEAs and CCAs. The second part of the paper provides a detailed review of the deformation mechanisms of HEAs with the FCC and BCC structures. For the former, we chose the CrMnFeCoNi (Cantor) alloy because it is the alloy on which the most rigorous and thorough investigations have been performed and, for the latter, we chose the TiZrHfNbTa (Senkov) alloy because this is one of the few refractory HEAs that exhibits any tensile ductility at room temperature. As expected, our review shows that the fundamental deformation mechanisms in these systems, and their dependence on basic physical properties, are broadly similar to those of conventional FCC and BCC metals. The third part of this review examines the theoretical and modeling efforts to date that seek to provide either qualitative or quantitative understanding of the mechanical performance of FCC and BCC HEAs. Since experiments reveal no fundamentally new mechanisms of deformation, this section starts with an overview of modeling perspectives and fundamental considerations. The review then turns to the evolution of modeling and predictions as compared to recent experiments, highlighting both successes and limitations. Finally, in spite of some significant successes, important directions for further theory development are discussed. Overall, while the individual deformation mechanisms or properties of the HEAs and CCAs are not, by and large, “special” relative to conventional alloys, the present HEA rush remains valuable because the compositional freedom that comes from the multi-element space will allow exploration of whether multiple mechanisms can operate sequentially or simultaneously, which may yet lead to the creation of new alloys with a spectrum of mechanical properties that are significantly superior to those of current engineering alloys.},

abstract = {The ability of a metal to sustain plastic flow without permanently disrupting its crystal structure is a testimony to the nature of the metallic bond. The forces necessary to initiate deformation can be controlled by introducing obstacles that interfere with the smooth progress of plastic deformation. These strengthening mechanisms are the tools available to metallurgists in their efforts to design strong steels without compromising other properties. One particular property that is indispensable in safe engineering design, and which distinguishes steels from materials such as glass, carbon nanotubes or graphene, is the ability to absorb energy by plastic deformation prior to failure. The yearning for strength cannot and should not therefore be considered in isolation, but rather as one component in the holistic design of materials. Some notions about carbon based materials being 100–300 times stronger than steel are shown to be false.},

abstract = {The properties of Cr in $\alpha$ Fe have been investigated by ab initio calculations based on density functional theory. The intrinsic point defect formation energies were found to be larger in model bcc Cr as compared to those in ferromagnetic bcc Fe. The interactions of Cr with point defects (vacancy and self-interstitials) have been characterized. Single Cr atoms interact weakly with vacancies but significantly with self-interstitial atoms (SIA). Mixed interstitials of any interstitial symmetry are bound. Configurations where two Cr atoms are in nearest-neighbor position are generally unfavorable in bcc Fe except when they are a part of a ⟨111⟩ interstitial complex. Mixed ⟨110⟩ interstitials do not have as strong directional stability as pure Fe interstitials have. The effects on the results using the atom description scheme of either the ultrasoft pseudopotential (USPP) or the projector augmented wave (PAW) formalisms are connected to the differences in local magnetic moments that the two methods predict. As expected for the Fe-Cr system, the results obtained using the PAW method are more reliable than the ones obtained with USPP.},

abstract = {Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have great potential for aerospace engineering applications as high-temperature load-bearing structures or thermal protection systems. However, there is still a lack of in-depth study on their oxidation mechanism and structural evolution, which would considerably have a negative impact on their mechanical properties. In this study, nano-structured RHEA W–Nb–Mo–Ta–V–O films were developed by magnetron sputtering. Subsequently, oxidation experiments were carried out under different temperatures to study their oxidation behavior, and the influence on microstructure and mechanical properties were further investigated. The results showed that the as-deposited film had a very fine nanocrystalline structure with a typical body-centred cubic (BCC) solid solution phase. There was no significant change in the crystallite size when the film was oxidized below 400 °C for 2 h, and the RHEA film exhibited a specific structure and phase stability. As the oxidation temperature increased to 500 °C, the crystallite size increased from 5.588 nm to 6.549 nm. Most specifically, the RHEA film was completely oxidized when the temperature reached 600 °C. The nanohardness and elastic modulus of the deposited films were 8.58 ± 0.85 GPa and 148.02 ± 7.48 GPa, respectively, and decreased rapidly to 4.58 ± 0.32 GPa and 96.6 ± 4.47 GPa after oxidation at 500 °C for 2 h. However, the films exhibited stable mechanical properties under oxidation conditions up to 400 °C, which would provide a new paradigm for future high-temperature applications.},

Here, we investigate a CoCuFeNiPd high-entropy alloy (HEA), using a combination of Monte Carlo method, molecular dynamic simulation, and density-functional theory calculation. Our results show that this HEA is energetically favorable to undergo short-range ordering (SRO), and the SRO leads to a pseudo-composite microstructure, which surprisingly enhances both the ultimate strength and ductility. The SRO-induced composite microstructure consists of three categories of clusters: face-center-cubic-preferred (FCCP) clusters, indifferent clusters, and body-center-cubic-preferred (BCCP) clusters, with the indifferent clusters playing the role of the matrix, the FCCP clusters serving as hard fillers to enhance the strength, while the BCCP clusters acting as soft fillers to increase the ductility. Our work highlights the importance of SRO in influencing the mechanical properties of HEAs and presents a fascinating route for designing HEAs to achieve superior mechanical properties.},

Three types of transformations were observed: the $\beta$ → $\omega$ transformation during cooling in Nb0.2 HEA, the deformation-induced $\beta$ → $\alpha$″ and $\beta$ → $\alpha$′ transformations in Nb0.4 and Nb0.2 HEAs, respectively. This implies that the phonon anomalies, T11/2(110) and L2/3(111), as the origins of phase transformations in simple Ti, Zr and Hf alloys, also exist in composition-complex TiZrHf-based HEAs. However, the very small fraction of deformation-induced $\alpha$′/$\alpha$″ martensite in fractured Nb0.4 and Nb0.2 suggests a sluggish effect of transformation as compared with simple $\beta$-Ti alloys.},

For reliable operation, the operating temperature of alloys may need to stay below Tbreak. We introduce a technique of global optimization, one enabling concurrent optimization of model parameters over low-temperature and high-temperature regimes. Furthermore, we suggest a general framework for joint optimization of alloy properties, capable of accounting for physics-based dependencies, and show how a special case can be formulated to address the identification of HEAs offering attractive ultimate strength. We advocate for the selection of an optimization technique suitable for the problem at hand and the data available, and for properly accounting for the underlying sources of variations.},

abstract = {Many of the purported virtues of Multi-Principal Element Alloys (MPEAs), such as corrosion, high-temperature oxidation and irradiation resistance, are highly sensitive to vacancy diffusivity. Similarly, solute interdiffusion is governed by vacancy diffusion -- it is often unclear whether MPEAs are truly stable, or effectively stabilized by slow interdiffusion. The considerable composition space afforded to these alloys makes optimizing for desired properties a daunting task; theoretical and computational tools are necessary to guide alloy development. For diffusion, such tools depend on both a knowledge of the vacancy migration barriers within a given alloy and an understanding of how these barriers influence vacancy diffusivity. We present a generalized theory of vacancy diffusion in rugged energy landscapes, paired with Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of MPEA vacancy diffusion. The barrier energy statistics are informed by nudged elastic band calculations in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn alloy. Theory and simulations show that vacancy diffusion in solid-solution MPEAs is not necessarily sluggish, but can potentially be tuned, and that trap models are an insufficient explanation for sluggish diffusion in the CoNiCrFeMn HEA. These results also show that any model that endeavors to faithfully represent diffusion-related phenomena must account for the full nature of the energy landscape, not just the migration barriers.},

In the initial condition after annealing at 1473 K for 24 h the alloys was composed of B2 matrix phase and coarse Zr5Al3-type particles. During creep a limited amount of new Nb2Al-type sigma phase precipitates at the Zr5Al3/B2 hetero-phase interface and a quasi-stationary dislocation density of the expected order of magnitude are developed. The quasi-stationary creep rate obeys a three-power law and the transients after stress changes are inverted.

Wrought-and-recovered sheet consisting of small subgrains had the lowest DBTT of 70°C, but this was raised to 225°C by the onset of primary recrystallization at 11150°C. Primary grain growth was inhibited at annealing temperatures between 1300° and 2200°C. Secondary recrystallization started at 2000°C from one surface and the new grains grew readily. All recrystallized specimens had DBTTs in the range 235°-280°C, irrespective of annealing temperature, grain size and fracture mode. Primary recrystallized specimens fractured mainly along the grain boundaries, but secondary recrystallized specimens fractured mainly by transgranular cleavage initiated from a grain-boundary source. These results are consistent with a picture of grain growth and embrittlement involving impurities segregated at the grain boundaries, the high DBTT in the recrystallized tungsten being determined by the initiation of a brittle crack at a grain boundary. {\textcopyright} 1967.},

It was observed that hydrogen induced transgranular cracking initiates at micro-voids in the crystal lattice. Similar behaviour has been observed in multi-scale finite element chemo-mechanical numerical simulations. In contrast, hydrogen induced localized slip intergranular cracking was associated with the formation of micro-voids in intergranular regions. The effects of grain boundary and triple junction character on intergranular hydrogen embrittlement were also investigated. It was observed that low end high angle misorientations (LHAM), 15°{\textless}$\theta$ ≤ 35°, and critical high angle misorientations (CHAM), 35° {\textless} 50°, are preferential sites for hydrogen induced cracking.

@article{Miracle2017,
abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) are barely 12 years old. The field has stimulated new ideas and has inspired the exploration of the vast composition space offered by multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs). Here we present a critical review of this field, with the intent of summarizing key findings, uncovering major trends and providing guidance for future efforts. Major themes in this assessment include definition of terms; thermodynamic analysis of complex, concentrated alloys (CCAs); taxonomy of current alloy families; microstructures; mechanical properties; potential applications; and future efforts. Based on detailed analyses, the following major results emerge. Although classical thermodynamic concepts are unchanged, trends in MPEAs can be different than in simpler alloys. Common thermodynamic perceptions can be misleading and new trends are described. From a strong focus on 3d transition metal alloys, there are now seven distinct CCA families. A new theme of designing alloy families by selecting elements to achieve a specific, intended purpose is starting to emerge. A comprehensive microstructural assessment is performed using three datasets: experimental data drawn from 408 different alloys and two computational datasets generated using the CALculated PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method. Each dataset emphasizes different elements and shows different microstructural trends. Trends in these three datasets are all predicted by a ‘structure in – structure out' (SISO) analysis developed here that uses the weighted fractions of the constituent element crystal structures in each dataset. A total of 13 distinct multi-principal element single-phase fields are found in this microstructural assessment. Relationships between composition, microstructure and properties are established for 3d transition metal MPEAs, including the roles of Al, Cr and Cu. Critical evaluation shows that commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys with 3 or more principal elements are MPEAs, as well as some established functional materials. Mechanical properties of 3d transition metal CCAs are equivalent to commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys, while some refractory metal CCAs show potential to extend the service strength and/or temperature of nickel superalloys. Detailed analyses of microstructures and properties allow two major HEA hypotheses to be resolved. Although the ‘entropy effect' is not supported by the present data, it has nevertheless made an enduring contribution by inspiring a clearer understanding of the importance of configurational entropy on phase stability. The ‘sluggish diffusion' hypothesis is also not supported by available data, but it motivates re-evaluation of a classical concept of metallic diffusion. Building on recent published work, the CCA field has expanded to include materials with metallic, ionic or covalent bonding. It also includes microstructures with any number of phases and any type of phases. Finally, the MPEA field is shown to include both structural and functional materials applications. A significant number of future efforts are recommended, with an emphasis on developing high-throughput experiments and computations for structural materials. The review concludes with a brief description of major accomplishments of the field and insights gained from the first 12 years of research. The field has lost none of its potency and continues to pose new questions and offer new possibilities. The vast range of complex compositions and microstructures remains the most compelling motivation for future studies.},

The effects of short-range ordering is shown to be important in the 50-50 alloy. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Senkov2001,
abstract = {A topological approach based on analysis of atomic size distributions has been developed and applied to multicomponent amorphous alloys with different glass-forming ability. The atomic size distributions were obtained by plotting atomic concentrations versus atomic radii of constitutive elements. Ordinary amorphous alloys with high critical cooling rates were found to have single-peak distributions with a concave downward shape. These amorphous systems have at least one alloying element with a smaller radius, and at least one alloying element with a larger radius relative to the base element. The concentration of an alloying element decreases rapidly as the difference in the atomic sizes of the base element and the alloying element increases. Atomic size distributions of Zr, Pd, or Ln-based bulk amorphous alloys, which have a critical cooling rate in the range of 1-100 K/s, have a completely different, concave upward shape with a minimum at an intermediate atomic size. The base alloying element in these alloys has the largest atomic size and the smallest atom often has the next-highest concentration. A model that explains the concave upward shape of atomic size distributions for the bulk amorphous alloys is suggested. This model takes into account that all alloying elements in bulk glass formers are smaller than the matrix element, and some of them are located in interstitial sites while others substitute for matrix atoms in a reference crystalline solid solution. The interstitial and substitutional atoms attract each other and produce short-range ordered atomic configurations that stabilize the amorphous state. According to this model, the critical concentration of an interstitial element required to amorphize the alloy increases with increasing size difference from the matrix atom. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The aim of this report is to define the key parameters and features of an IP P/O system, how they are influenced, what are the systems and stakeholders involved and, qualitatively, how they are influenced. This is done in order to explain and better understand the decisions made during the design and development of the T1000, why certain solutions have been selected and others rejected, which areas of P/O design require particular attention and what are the lessons learnt. The first part of this document is aimed at better understanding the theory and the rationale behind the IP P/O system and its influences on the engine. In order to do this different topics are discussed, starting from Load requirements, Idle setting, Engine weight, Fuel burn, Starting performance, Thermodynamic and Mechanical aspects, Secondary air system features and Noise. The second part is aimed at reviewing the design procedure using the Systems Thinking approach, i.e. considering the P/O system not just as the sum of its components but as a system with different properties, functions and effects. The review of the design process starts from the Definition of Requirements, proceeds with the Stakeholders Analysis (only the most affected are considered in detail) and ends with a review of the system on the actual engine (Trent 1000 Pack B): relation between requirements, functions and implementation, review of ERMS and Lessons Learnt databases and FMECA report.},

abstract = {Scientific exploration in the field of high entropy alloys, known as HEAs, has recently exploded. First reported in about 2004, HEAs were defined originally as a blend of five or more elements with concentrations between 5 to 35 atom percent, and with a strong preference towards single-phase, solid solution metallic alloys. Later, the field branched to include intermetallic and ceramic compounds, alloys with as few as three principle elements, and microstructures with any number and type of phases. Today, researchers face vast combinations of elements with which to work, and they eagerly seek to learn more about HEA compositions, microstructures, promising property combinations, and opportunities for a wide variety of applications in both structural and functional materials. HEA development offers tremendous potential not only for expanding scientific knowledge, but also for creating a broad range of revolutionary products for strategic, economic, and national security benefits. “Defining Pathways for Realizing the Revolutionary Potential of High Entropy Alloys” is organized by TMS on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) via the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The study examines the extensive work being performed in this emerging field with the goal of providing science and technology pathways to accelerate realization of the wide-reaching potential of HEAs in some key application areas and alloy categories.},

abstract = {In the present study, the phase evolution and microstructure of CrMoNbTiW, a new equi-atomic refractory high-entropy alloy, are studied. The alloy was synthesized through mechanical alloying (MA) followed by consolidation using spark plasma sintering. After MA, a major BCC solid solution along with residual Cr and Nb were observed. However, secondary phases such as Laves and carbides were also observed in addition to the major BCC solid solution after sintering. Unsolicited contamination from the milling media is found to be one of the reasons for the formation of secondary phases. The high hardness of 8.9 GPa after sintering was attributed to the presence of secondary phases along with the nanocrystalline nature of the alloy. To understand the phase evolution, calculation of phase diagram was carried out using CALPHAD. Further, binary phase diagram inspection and simple empirical parameters were also used to assess their effectiveness in predicting phases.},

The first practical gas turbine used to generate electricity ran at Neuchatel, Switzerland in 1939, and was developed by the Brown Boveri Company. The first gas turbine powered airplane flight also took place in 1939 in Germany, using the gas turbine developed by Hans P. von Ohain.

Recently, much attention has been focused on refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs), which also possess bcc crystal structures. However, unlike face-centered cubic high-entropy alloys (HEAs), there have been far fewer investigations on bcc HEAs, specifically on the possible effects of chemical short-range order in these multiple principal element alloys on dislocation mobility. Here, using density functional theory, we investigate the distribution of dislocation core properties in MoNbTaW RHEAs alloys, and how they are influenced by local chemical short-range order (SRO). The distribution of dislocation core energies and Peierls potentials are investigated systematically and reveal a marked effect of SRO in elevating the Peierls potential of screw dislocations. The computational results thus suggest potentially important effects of SRO on dislocation morphologies and their motion.},

abstract = {Predicting material properties of off-stoichiometry systems remains a long-standing and formidable challenge in rational materials design. A proper analysis of such systems by means of a supercell approach requires the exhaustive consideration of all possible superstructures, which can be a time-consuming process. On the contrary, the use of quasirandom approximants, although very computationally effective, implicitly bias the analysis toward disordered states with the lowest site correlations. Here, we propose a novel framework designed specifically to investigate stoichiometrically driven trends of disordered systems (i.e., having partial occupation and/or disorder in the atomic sites). At the heart of the approach is the identification and analysis of unique supercells of a virtually equivalent stoichiometry to the disordered material. We employ Boltzmann statistics to resolve system-wide properties at a high-throughput (HT) level. To maximize efficiency and accessibility, we integrated the method within the automatic HT computational framework Aflow. As proof of concept, we apply our approach to three systems of interest, a zinc chalcogenide (ZnS1-xSex), a wide-gap oxide semiconductor (MgxZn1-xO), and an iron alloy (Fe1-xCux), at various stoichiometries. These systems exhibit properties that are highly tunable as a function of composition, characterized by optical bowing and linear ferromagnetic behavior. Not only are these qualities successfully predicted, but additional insight into underlying physical mechanisms is revealed.},

Here we report the discovery of an unexpected $\gamma$″ precipitation mechanism at TBs that takes the responsibility for alloy failure in demanding environments. Using multiscale microstructural and mechanical characterisations (from millimetre down to atomic level) and DFT calculations, we demonstrate that abnormal $\gamma$″ precipitation along TBs accounts for the premature dislocation activities and pronounced strain localisation associated with TBs during mechanical loading, which serves as a precursor for crack initiation. We clarify the physical origin of the TBs-related cracking at the atomic level of $\gamma$″-strengthened Ni-based superalloys in a hydrogen containing environment, and provide practical methods to mitigate the adverse effect of TBs on the performance of these alloys.},

The origin of Vanadium's special role is its atomic volume: large in the fcc alloys and small in the bcc alloys, and thus having a large misfit volume in both crystalline structures. A parameter-free theory applicable to both fcc and bcc HEAs rationalizes this finding, with predictions of strength across a range of fcc and bcc alloys in quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments. In the fcc class, the analysis demonstrates why the newly-discovered NiCoV and Ni0.632V0.368 alloys have far higher strength than any other fcc alloy and are predicted to be the highest attainable. In the bcc class, the analysis demonstrates that the addition of V always increases the strength relative to the same alloys without V. The optimization of complex alloys for high strength should thus center around the inclusion of V as a primary element at concentration levels of around 25 at.{\%}},

The total mechanicalproperty data base, as available in both the open and ‘closed' literature (e.g. national and industrial laboratory reports), is reviewed and found to be much larger than is generally recognized. The mechanical properties of unalloyed vanadium and the effects of interstitial solutes are well established. The rather large data base is summarized to provide a concise description of interstitial effects on tensile, creep, fatigue, and ductility behaviour. A large number of substitutional solutes have been studied as binary, ternary, and higher order alloying additions; data for these systems are compiled and discussed with regard to the comparative strengthening effects of various solutes. Additional discussion focuses on such topics as deformation and fracture behaviour and mechanisms, the importance of grain size and other microstructural features, and recovery and recrystallization phenomena. In view of the importance of phase relationships and solubilities, solute diffusivity, and elastic properties, relevant data are provided on these topics in Appendixes. {\textcopyright} 1980 Maney Publishing.},

abstract = {A necessary criterion for brittle fracture in crystals is established in terms of the spontaneous emission of dislocations from an atomically sharp cleavage crack. We have calculated the stability of a sharp crack against emission of a blunting dislocation for a number of crystals and crystal types in two dimensions and the energy to form a stable loop of dislocation from the crack tip in three dimensions. We find that contrary to previous expectations, an atomically sharp cleavage crack is stable in a wide range of crystal types, but that in the face centred cubic metals investigated, blunting reactions occur spontaneously. Of the body centred metals investigated, iron is an intermediate case between the brittle and ductile cases, and the ionic and covalent crystals investigated are all stable against dislocation emission. Qualitatively, we find that crystals whose dislocations have wide cores, and small values of the parameter $\mu$b/$\gamma$($\mu$b/$\gamma$ ≲7{\textperiodcentered}5 to 10) are ductile while crystals with narrow cores and large values of $\mu$b/$\gamma$ are brittle. {\textcopyright} 1974, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {Phase diagrams are the key to understanding of high-entropy alloy formation. This chapter first presents the basics of CALPHAD (acronym of Calculation of Phase Diagrams) methodology and then details the procedures used in developing self-consistent thermodynamic databases tailored for HEA systems. A self-consistent thermodynamic database (PanHEA) has been developed for the Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni system that covers the complete compositional ranges for all its constituent binaries and ternaries, and it will be useful for future HEA design and processing optimization. HEA formation from the thermodynamic point of view is then illustrated for three HEA systems using TCNI7 database: FCC-forming Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni, FCC- and BCC-forming Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni, and BCC-forming Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-V-W systems. The FCC system shows large positive excess entropy while the BCC system shows small negative excess entropy, and these results are consistent with their vibrational entropies of mixing predicted from first-principle calculations presented in Chap. 10 “Applications of Special Quasi-random Structures to High-Entropy Alloys.” Addition of Al to CoCrFeNi stabilizes the BCC phase via the dominating enthalpy effect. The present study demonstrates that configurational entropy does not always dominate, and enthalpy and competing phases need to be considered in terms of phase stability. Applications of CALPHAD to high-entropy alloy design and microstructure development are then presented for the case of several alloys and satisfactory agreement between modeling calculations and experimental results is observed. Various isotherms and isopleths of the Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni system are predicted. Future perspectives on CALPHAD development including short-range ordering and kinetic database development pertaining to HEAs conclude this chapter.},

abstract = {The dynamical and thermodynamical stability of the bcc and fcc disordered RexW1-xsystem is studied within the density-functional theory. The configurational part of the free energy is obtained from ab initio electron structure calculations together with the cluster expansion and the cluster variation formalism. Electronic excitations are accounted for through the temperature-dependent Fermi-Dirac distribution. The lattice dynamics of Re and W is studied using the density-functional linear-response theory. The calculated dispersion curves show that fcc Re is dynamically stable while bcc Re exhibits phonon instabilities in large parts of the Brillouin zone, similar to previous results for fcc W. Interestingly, the phonon dispersion curves for fcc Re show pronounced phonon anomalies characteristic of superconductors such as TaC and NbC. Due to the instabilities in bcc Re and fcc W the vibrational entropy, and therefore the free energy, is undefined. In order to predict the regions where the disordered RexW1-xalloy is unstable we calculate the phonon dispersion curves in the virtual crystal approximation. Then we apply a concentration-dependent nonlinear interpolation to the force constants, which are calculated through a Born–von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n fit to the ab initio obtained dynamical matrices. The vibrational free energy is calculated in the stable regions for the phases as a function of concentration. The complete analysis gives a region where the bcc phase would become thermodynamically unstable towards a phase decomposition into disordered bcc and fcc phases. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The impact of a concentrated solid solution on the deformation mechanisms of a bcc multi-principal elements alloy is investigated. The room temperature mechanical properties in tension and simple shear are studied on samples with controlled microstructure. The partition of the various stress components is performed, as well as the determination of the activation volumes and the analysis of the dislocation density and velocity. The study of the mechanical behavior is coupled to a complete TEM investigation. The alloy displays a high yield strength that is explained by a strong impact of the short-range obstacles to the dislocation glide, with an enhancement of the effective stress due to the concentrated solid solution. The increase of the backstress is related to the formation of a heterogeneous dislocation structure, with dense dislocation bands acting as long-range obstacles. Deformation is controlled by screw dislocation glide. The a/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} screw dislocations are rectilinear, indicating a high lattice friction effect. Evolution of both dislocation velocity and density during multirelaxation transients suggests a low mobility. If activation volumes are consistent with a Peierls mechanism, other considerations rather head towards the hypothesis of a transitory regime where the solid solution could impact further the dislocation glide.},

abstract = {The microstructure, thermal and mechanical stability of Ni-based single crystalline superalloys depend strongly on the alloying elements and their concentrations. Alloying has been the main design strategy for stabilizing the compositions, microstructures and thermal-mechanical properties. This article presents a review on the effects of some common alloying elements on the microstructural and mechanical property stability control of Ni-based superalloys. The various alloying elements are divided into four categories according to their main effects on these properties, comprising base elements, mechanical strengthening elements, long term stability elements and the oxidation resistance elements. The mechanical strengthening elements can further be divided into precipitation, solid solution and grain boundary segregation elements. The precipitation elements strengthen the alloys by forming the L12structured $\gamma$ʹ phase. The solid solution elements strengthen primarily the $\gamma$ phase, by increasing the solidus temperatures and decreasing the stacking fault energy, which in turn influences the thermal stability of the phases and the resistance of dislocation movement. The grain boundary elements strengthen the alloys by the formation of carbides and borides along the grain boundaries during solidification, which help to prevent the formation of casting pores and hot tearing and to strengthen low angle boundaries. The long-term stability elements inhibit the precipitation of topologically closed-packed phases causing deterioration of the mechanical properties. The oxidation resistance element, mainly Al, promotes the formation of protective Al2O3surface layer.},

abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted much attention since they can possess some unique properties. By adjusting their multi-principal elements, some systems with body centered cubic (BCC) structure could obtain an excellent trade-off of strength and ductility, e.g. recently reported single-phase Hf0.5Nb0.5Ta0.5Ti1.5Zr refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA). However, researchers found that some HEAs are thermally metastable and could decompose within a certain temperature range. The thermal stability is especially important for RHEAs which are promising for high-temperature applications. Here we evaluated the phase stability of a BCC Hf0.5Nb0.5Ta0.5Ti1.5Zr RHEA after anneals for two weeks at 500–900 °C. Microstructural analyses, performed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transparent electron microscopy, show that the RHEA is a single-phase solid solution after recrystallization for 3 h at 1000 °C and remains in this state after a subsequent anneal at 900 °C for two weeks. However, it is unstable and forms second-phase precipitates at and below 800 °C. Tiny precipitates on the grain boundaries (GBs) were observed in the sample annealed at 800 °C. Annealed at 700 °C, precipitates with BCC structure (termed as BCC2) both on the GBs as chains and at intragranular regions as petaloid morphology are present. After the anneal at 500 °C, the RHEA decomposes into multi-phase microstructures with different morphologies: lamellar structure close to the GBs composed of BCC1 and BCC2 phases, and convoluted basket-like structure inside grains comprising a third hexagonal close-packed phase precipitates except for both BCC phases. Thus the phase stability of this RHEA should be carefully evaluated for elevated temperature applications.},

abstract = {Recent interest in chemically-complex solid-solution alloys has produced a number of new refractory BCC alloys with superior high-temperature properties. Preliminary atomistic studies show that, unlike simple BCC metals, these alloys produce equilibrium (screw) dislocations spread on varying glide planes along their length. This observation suggests that under load such defects produce kinks on different glide planes leading to a distribution of pinning points that significantly increases high-temperature strength. In order to validate this model a first-principle approach is developed to characterize these sub-nanoscale structures. We find significant spreading of the dislocation onto varying {\{}110{\}} planes (partial kinks) in NbTiZr and Nb17Ti33Zr50, while Nb50Ti33Zr17 produces a straight-compact dislocation as found in simple BCC metals. Chemical analysis around the dislocation indicate that the partial kinks form in response to increasing (decreasing) Ti and Zr (Nb) compositions. These results validate a growing body of work on understanding the hardening mechanisms in chemically-complex alloys.},

Different aspects of the phenomenon are discussed in the light of the theories worked out during the past thirty years, from McLean's equilibrium theory to the double equilibrium segregation theory presented recently by Guttmann. The latter takes into account the interaction between impurities and alloy elements. The new techniques of surface analysis, Auger electron spectroscopy, ESCA, and ion back scattering spectroscopy, which have made it possible to elucidate by quantitative measurements the segregation processes responsible for temper embrittlement, are described.},

abstract = {Although small size and tunable surface properties of metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver (AuNP, AgNP) have been explored in many biomedical applications, their effect on protein amyloid fibrillation and defibrillation has partly been investigated. Here, we synthesized starch and polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalized AuNP and AgNP and explored their effect on amyloid fibrillation, defibrillation and cytotoxicity of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) as a model protein. Our experimental results revealed that lower concentration of PEGylated NPs (0.1–1 $\mu$M) exhibited higher anti-amyloid activity than starch capped NPs while higher concentration (5–20 $\mu$M), however showed nearly equal effect for both. Such inhibiting properties were attributed to the modulation of surface charge, surface hydrophobicity and capping agent of NPs. We further observed NP-mediated profound inhibition of fibril formation only during nucleation phase of amyloid growth. Defibrillation study of HEWL amyloid further revealed that starch functionalized NPs can defibrillate more efficiently than PEGylated NPs. When cytotoxicity of amyloid was assessed in mice neural (N2a) and human keratinocytes cells (HaCaT), amyloid samples prepared with NPs showed much reduced cytotoxicity compared to the untreated sample. Experimental results further showed that the reduction of cytotoxicity by NPs was mediated via preventing free radical generation. Overall, we concluded that appropriate selection of core material, surface modification and administration time of NP might be the key in inhibiting amyloid fibrillation and triggering defibrillation process of HEWL effectively.},

abstract = {The effect of W, Mo, V, Ta, and Nb, five common $\beta$-stabilizing substitutional elements, on $\alpha$-Ti stacking fault energy has been studied using first principle calculations. The generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curves have been determined for different concentrations of $\beta$-stabilizers at the fault plane using supercells with up to 360 atoms. Both basal and prismatic slip systems with the stable ($\gamma$SF) and unstable ($\gamma$USF) stacking faults and twinning fault energies were determined. All the alloying elements reduce the stacking fault energy for Ti for both basal and prismatic slip. At higher concentration of 25 at. {\%} of V, Ta, and Nb at the slip plane, the basal slip becomes more favorable than the prismatic slip in Ti. Ti-Mo and Ti-W systems also show a significant shift in the GSFE curve towards a higher shear deformation strain along « 0110 » due to the change in bond character between Ti and those two elements. Using Rice criterion, which employs $\gamma$S/$\gamma$USF ratio to estimate ductility, we show that all the alloying elements likely improve the ductility of $\alpha$-Ti with Ti-25 at. {\%} Nb exhibiting the most ductile behavior. However, according to the Tadmor and Bernstein model, all the alloying elements considered here do not improve the partial dislocation emission or the twinning propensity in spite of decreasing the stacking fault energies for $\alpha$-Ti and. Hence, a better empirical model that incorporates changes in the character of directional bonding upon alloying is needed to estimate how alloying influences ductility in hcp metals.},

abstract = {Pure tungsten and tungsten alloys with minor alloying additions are known to be brittle at room temperature and have high ductile-to-brittle transition temperatures (DBTT). Improving the ductility of tungsten can have significant impact on both the manufacturing of and the range of applications of tungsten. Although there has been a significant volume of reported research on improving the ductility of tungsten over the span of several decades, it remains a difficult challenge. This is at least partially attributable to the fact that the understanding on the mechanical properties of tungsten and their dependence on microstructure has been insufficient. This article attempts to offer a critical review of the methods that have been reported in the literature for improving the ductility of tungsten in order to understand the critical factors that control the ductility (or lack thereof) in tungsten. It is clear from the literature that all tungsten materials that have been reported to be ductile at room temperature, or to have drastically reduced DBTT, are the result of thermomechanically processed (TMP) material with deformed and textured microstructures. Alloying tungsten with rhenium is essentially the only known method to improve the ductility of tungsten by alloying (excluding the class of alloys known as heavy alloys which are composites of tungsten with nickel and iron). Although there have been a large number of research reports in recent years on the effect of additives, including oxides, carbides, and others, the results are inconclusive to date or insignificant with respect to the effects of those additives on the ductility of tungsten independent of the effects of thermomechanical working. Using ultrafine-grained or nanocrystalline microstructure to improve the ductility of tungsten is another approach that has appeared promising. However, the results to date have not shown that the ductility of tungsten can be improved by reducing the grain size alone, without the benefits of thermomechanical processed or deformed microstructures. Another objective of this review is to examine the correlation between the ductility of tungsten and different microstructures resulting from different processing methods and compositions.},

These novel MEAs were derived from a recently developed equiatomic Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta MEA by gradually replacing its Ta content with Ti. Each non-equiatomic MEA solidified as a single solid-solution phase, which was characterised in detail and compared with Pandat™ simulation and empirical rules. Systematic tensile mechanical property data revealed the existence of a brittle-to-ductile transition for Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta MEAs, i.e., when 15 at{\%} of Ta in the equiatomic Ti25-Zr25-Nb25-Ta25 MEA was replaced by Ti to become a Ti40-Zr25-Nb25-Ta10 MEA. The transition occurs corresponding to a small reduction in atomic mismatch from 4.72{\%} to 4.65{\%} but a signficant drop in nanoindentation hardness from 4.2 GPa to 3.5 GPa. In particular, both the as-cast Ti40-Zr25-Nb25-Ta10 and Ti45-Zr25-Nb25-Ta5 MEAs exhibited excellent tensile strain to fracture ({\textgreater}18{\%}) and tensile strength ({\textgreater}900 MPa) with much reduced density compared to the brittle Ti25-Zr25-Nb25-Ta25 MEA. They are both among a very small number of strong and ductile (tensile strain {\textgreater}15{\%}) HEAs reported to date. Their tensile mechanical properties can be further tuned by adjusting the atomic mismatch of the resulting single solid-solution phase in conjunction with the improved understanding of the microstructures of these MEAs.},

First-principles calculations of the energy landscapes along crystallographic pathways that connect bcc to hcp and bcc to $\omega$ show that group 4 elements are very distinct from group 5 and 6 elements. While group 5 and 6 elements are stable in bcc, group 4 elements favor hcp and $\omega$ and are predicted to be dynamically unstable in bcc. A comprehensive first-principles investigation of the 36 refractory binary systems using statistical mechanics techniques reveals six distinct classes of alloys, each with a unique phase diagram topology. The predictions of this study are in excellent agreement with previous experimental work. One exception is a class of refractory alloys with high temperature miscibility gaps that are not predicted with the methods used in this work. Our calculations predict the stability of a low-temperature Laves phase in the Nb-V binary that has yet to be observed experimentally. The relationships between alloy chemistry and high-temperature phase stability revealed in this study provide a basis for the systematic design of multicomponent disordered refractory alloys.},

abstract = {Concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs) based on 3d transition metals have demonstrated extraordinary mechanical properties and radiation resistance associated with their low stacking fault energies (SFEs). Owing to the intrinsic disorder, SFEs in CSAs exhibit distributions depending on local atomic configurations. In this work, the distribution of SFEs in equiatomic CSAs of NiCo, NiFe, and NiCoCr are investigated based on empirical potential and first-principles calculations. We show that the calculated distribution of SFEs in chemically disordered CSAs depends on the stacking fault area using empirical potential calculations. Based on electronic structure calculations, we find that local variations of SFEs in CSAs correlate with the charge density redistribution in the stacking fault region. We further propose a bond breaking and forming model to understand and predict the SFEs in CSAs based on the local structure alone. It is shown that the perturbation induced by a stacking fault is localized in the first-nearest planes for NiCo, but extends up to the third nearest planes for NiFe and NiCoCr because of partially filled d electrons in Fe and Cr.},

The results show that the generalized stacking-fault energy values for two slip systems all increase significantly after adding C, O, and N impurities in comparison with pure V. Moreover, the impurities located in the slip plane greatly increase the generalized stacking-fault energy, suggesting that the impurity effect is localized. The calculations reveal a remarkably strong dependence of the USF energies on the impurities concentration. Though evaluating the generalized stacking-fault energies and the ductility parameters, we draw a conclusion that impurities not only strengthen the V alloys but also reduce their plasticity.},

abstract = {The highly-strained lattice hypothesis in high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has led to an interest in local distortions created in substitutional solid-solution alloys. In this work, the use of total scattering for the assessment and analysis of local lattice strains in alloys is considered. Using two theoretical models, the variation in the width of peaks in the pair distribution function (PDF) with changes in composition, ordering and atomic radius is presented. Key practical considerations for the successful analysis of local lattice strains using this technique are discussed, with particular reference to sample preparation, instrumental and data processing effects. Further, the mitigation of errors in local-strain measurements caused by differences in the scattering length of constituent atoms is presented. This is concluded with a proposed methodology for the analysis of local strains using this technique.},

abstract = {The stacking fault energy (SFE) is fundamental to understand the mechanical behavior of materials, and is also closely related to the structural phase transition. In present work, the generalized stacking fault energies of basal plane for novel hexagonal close-packed high-entropy alloys Hf0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25Sc0.25−xAlx (x {\textless} 15{\%}) are studied using density functional theory and special quasi-random structure for modeling the chemical disorder, and the effect of aluminum is emphasized. With increase of Al content, the lattice constant a decreases, while c/a increases. Especially, the addition of Al is favorable to reduce the unstable and stable stacking fault energies of the studied alloys. The lower SFE further improves the ductility, creep resistance and yield strength of materials. Moreover, with replacement of Sc by Al, lower $\gamma$ISF/$\gamma$USF ratio of stable intrinsic SFE ($\gamma$ISF) to unstable intrinsic SFE ($\gamma$USF) and higher $\gamma$USF/$\gamma$UTF ratio of unstable intrinsic SFE to unstable twin-like SFE ($\gamma$UTF) suggest that although both the dislocation decomposition and twinning are favored, the dislocation decomposition is still predominant due to stronger decrease of $\gamma$ISF/$\gamma$USF. Furthermore, the much larger unstable twin-like SFE $\gamma$UTF than the unstable intrinsic SFE $\gamma$USF also indicates that the main deformation mechanism in Hf0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25Sc0.25−xAlx (x {\textless} 15{\%}) may be dislocation-mediated slip. The further calculated electronic structure shows that replacement of Sc by Al enhances the covalent bonding of high-entropy alloys Hf0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25Sc0.25−xAlx (x {\textless} 15{\%}), and reduces the energy difference during the sliding process, thus lower the stacking fault energy. The present investigation is very valuable and helpful for understanding and developing of high performance of novel hexagonal close-packed high-entropy alloys.},

Zinc sulfate turbidity measurements gave accurate results for total immunoglobulin except when hemolysis was present in the sample. A correction factor for hemoglobin that will minimize errors resulting from hemolysis was presented. Serum electrophoresis was also found to be an accurate quantitation method.

abstract = {This paper attempts to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of the brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in textured, pre-deformed, polycrystalline body-centred cubic metals. For this purpose, five tungsten sheets have been rolled out from one and the same sintered ingot representing degrees of deformation of 1.8, 2.5, 3.0, 3.4, and 4.1 (logarithmic notation). Electron backscatter diffraction measurements display the evolution of the microstructure with increasing degree of deformation. The mean grain size of the five sheets in the normal direction is 1.1, 0.59, 0.48, 0.37, and 0.3 $\mu$m. Toughness tests based on the K-concept have been performed and the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature of the five sheets has been determined. The crack system used was the L-T crack system. The results have been benchmarked against the BDT temperature of a sintered ingot. The results show a decrease of the BDT temperature with increasing degree of deformation starting from 600 °C (873 K) for the sintered ingot via 115 °C (388 K), 85 °C (358 K), 75 °C (348 K), 60 °C (333K) down to − 65 °C (208 K) for the most heavily deformed tungsten plate. The results are discussed against the background of (i) rolling induced lattice defects such as (i-a) vacancies, (i-b) dislocations (i-c) grain boundaries, (ii) crystallographic texture, (iii) the state of stress, (iv) impurities, (v) sinter pores, and (vi) the geometrical arrangement of areas with low and high fracture toughness. The authors postulate that the BDT is still controlled by the kink-pair nucleation process of a screw dislocation and that the BDT temperature scales with the spacing of dislocation sources (e.g. grain boundary ledges, low angle boundaries, debris loops) along the crack front.},

The $\gamma$-surfaces and the corresponding $\gamma$-curves of {\{}0 0 1{\}}, {\{}1 1 0{\}} and {\{}1 1 1{\}} planes for L12 Al3Ti were also obtained. It is shown that the nucleation and glide of perfect two collinear superpartials 1/2{\{}0 0 1{\}}〈1 1 0〉 bound to anti-phase boundary (APB) should be the main deformation mechanism in L12 Al3Ti.

Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions.

A total of 57 papers extracted from the two most relevant scientific databases for the area (Web of Science and Scopus), from 2010 to March 2021, were analysed and summarized. The research, analysis, and evaluation of these papers has provided an outlook of how the aircraft manufacturing industry is inserted into the I4.0 context, based on a classification of the I4.0 technologies maturity for this industrial branch. Then, a survey was performed with 12 specialists from 5 different aircraft manufacturing companies aiming to report the practical point-of-view in this area. Thus, this paper highlights and discusses the gaps found in the literature related to the I4.0 technologies applied to aircraft manufacturing and their main useful implications not only from the academic point-of-view but also from competitive business aspects, providing recommendations for industrial managers, engineers, and stakeholders. Finally, this paper proposes new opportunities and challenges for future research.},

These limitations can be overcome by a treatment as a variational problem on the energy level in 2D. The fundamental equations are given and applications to determine displacement profiles for dislocations and their dissociations are discussed. When the core misfit has a planar extension and the misfit energy in the glide plane - the $\gamma$-surface - is determined from ab initio methods, very reliable core configurations can be determined. For dislocations along close-packed lattice directions the misfit energy can be obtained by a summing procedure using Euler coordinates. When these dislocations are dissociated multiple equilibrium configurations with different splitting widths can exist, but the values of energy difference in between - the Peierls energy - are too small to be determined reliably, considering the simplifying assumptions of the model. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Lee2018a,
abstract = {The maximization of the mixing entropy with the optimal range of enthalpy in high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can promote the formation of a stable single solid-solution phase with the absence of competing intermetallic compounds. The resultant effects, such as lattice distortion, can contribute to excellent mechanical properties, which has motivated numerous efforts to develop and design single-phase HEAs. However, challenges still remain, particularly on quantifying the lattice distortion and relating it to materials properties. In this study, we have developed a NbTaTiV refractory HEA with a single body-centered-cubic (BCC) structure using an integrated experimental and theoretical approach. The theoretical efforts include thermodynamic modeling, i.e., CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD). The microstructural evolutions have been investigated by systematic heat-treatment processes. The typical dendrite microstructure was observed, which is caused by the elemental segregation during the solidification in the as-cast condition. The structural inhomogeneity and chemical segregation were completely eliminated by the proper homogenization treatment at 1200 °C for 3 days. The homogeneous elemental distribution was quantitatively verified by the Atom Probe Tomography (APT) technique. Importantly, results indicate that this HEA exhibits the high yield strength and ductility at both room and high temperatures (up to 900 °C). Furthermore, the effects of the high mixing entropy on the mechanical properties are discussed and quantified in terms of lattice distortions and interatomic interactions of the NbTaTiV HEA via first-principles calculations. It is found that the local severe lattice distortions are induced, due to the atomic interactions and atomic-size mismatch in the homogenization-treated NbTaTiV refractory HEA.},

abstract = {For alloys with nanoprecipitate/matrix microstructures, the lattice coherency between the two phases plays an important role in determining the mechanical performances at high temperature. In this work, we systematically investigate the AlxCr13.3Fe71.5-xNi11.2Ti4 (x=8, 10, 12, 14, 16 at{\%}) complex concentrated alloys with an aim to enhance the lattice coherency between the BCC matrix and L21 precipitate. The precipitate microstructures, lattice misfit and the resultant coherency strain evolution are comprehensively studied. With increasing Al from 8 at{\%} to 16 at{\%}, the interfacial structure gradually transforms from semicoherent to fully coherent interface by the decrease in precipitate size and lattice misfit, which leads to the stronger elastic interaction between the matrix and precipitate. Meanwhile, the crystal structure of precipitate is slightly distorted from cubic to tetragonal. The yield strength of alloys at room temperature continuously increases with the addition of Al by the solid-solution strengthening and precipitation hardening effect. Here, the mechanism of precipitation hardening changes from Orowan process to coherency strengthening. Interestingly, the strengthening effect by Al addition is further amplified in the tensile test at 700 °C. The higher degree of lattice coherency and the distorted structure of the precipitate resulting from the Al addition lead to the effective strain transfer and the stronger precipitate, respectively. Therefore, the Al16Cr13.3Fe55.5Ni11.2Ti4 alloy exhibits an excellent combination of yield strength (400.8 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (572.9 MPa). These values are much higher than those of the previously reported nanoprecipiate-strengthened alloys, suggesting that the alloy is highly promising as high temperature structural applications.},
