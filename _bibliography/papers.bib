abstract = {High energy mechanically milled Alloy 617 ODS powder was consolidated by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique and subsequently annealed at 650 °C and 1050 °C (923 K and 1323 K). Microstructure and microtexture evolution during SPS and annealing have been investigated. SPS consolidated sample exhibited heterogeneous microstructure with ultra-fine grains surrounded by coarse grains. Inhomogeneous distribution of plastic deformation induced during ball milling resulted in heterogeneous nucleation and further grain growth during consolidation. The bimodal microstructure is advantageous with coarse grains providing ductility and fine grains providing strength by the Hall–Petch relationship. The bimodal grains structure was also retained during annealing. As-sintered specimen showed 〈100〉 texture parallel to the compression axis due to dynamic recrystallization during the SPS process. At 650 °C, annealed sample exhibited 〈111〉 annealing texture parallel to compression axis. The texture was randomized in sample annealed at 1050 °C. Precipitation analysis by SEM, XRD and TEM showed the presence of M23C6, M6C and Al2O3 in both As-sintered and annealed samples. Dispersoids analysis showed the presence of fine and uniform Y3Al5O12, Y4Al2O9 and a complex oxide rich in Ni, Y, Al and O. Stress–strain analysis from instrumented indentation test shows higher yield strength for Alloy 617 ODS in comparison with conventional Alloy 617.},

abstract = {The stringent environmental norms are pushing the aviation and power-generation industries to increase the operating temperatures of their jet-engines and gas-turbines which will improve the efficiencies of these energy conversion systems. Aviation and power generation industries are researching the alternatives for the currently used Ni-based superalloys, which is the most widely used material in the high-temperature region of these engines. Refractory alloys are being actively developed as an alternative to the Ni-based superalloys due to their high melting-points and superior strength retention capabilities at higher temperatures. Enhancing the intrinsic ductility of these refractory alloys has remained a challenge. Reducing the valence electron concentration (VEC) below 4.5 have been shown to improve the intrinsic ductility of few alloys, which means addition of Ti, Zr, and Hf can improve the ductility of refractory alloys. However, Re has been widely used to ductilize the W which goes contrary to the VEC criteria suggested in literature. The reason this seems to work is may be due to the reduced USFE of the alloy due to alloying with low USFE elements. Here we use density function theory (DFT) simulations to understand the factors affecting the ductility of refractory alloys. A DFT-based workflow is developed which reliably calculates the ductility parameter of refractory alloys. The developed workflow ensures that the error in estimating USFE is less than 50mJ/m{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}. The enthalpy, lattice distortion, and ductility parameter are calculated using DFT for Group IV, V, VI elements {\&} their 25 equiatomic binary alloys. The deformability of refractory BCC alloys is correlated with their enthalpy.},

abstract = {Present work studies 126 quaternary and 126 quinary equiatomic refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs), made from Group IV (Ti, Zr, Hf), Group V (V, Nb, Ta) and Group VI (Cr, Mo, W) elements. Rule-of-mixtures (ROM) technique is used to calculate liquidus temperature, density ($\rho$), Young's modulus (E), {\%} atomic size difference ($\delta$), valence electron concentration (VEC) and specific heat at constant pressure and at 1273 K (Cp). CALPHAD technique is used to predict the number of phases formed at 298 K, $\rho$ and liquidus temperature. ROM calculated densities are matching perfectly with CALPHAD values. Densities and E are directly proportional to the VEC and liquidus temperature of the alloys. Ti, Zr, Hf are ductilizing the alloys and making them light; whereas Cr, Mo and W, are reducing the alloys' ductility and making them heavy. For quinary RHEAs, Cp shows six distinct groups with $\delta$, but a similar trend is not observed in quaternary RHEAs. A methodology is developed to screen a large number of alloys based on various properties. Correlations between those properties are also studied.},

@article{Singh2020,
abstract = {FeCoCrNiCu high entropy alloy (HEA) powder was produced by mechanical alloying. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) were mixed in the HEA powder (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 wt.{\%} of CNT) and then the mixture was consolidated by spark plasma sintering at 800°C. Phase constitution of the pellets was sensitive to the CNT amount. With smaller quantities of CNTs (upto 2 wt.{\%}), the pellets contained a mixture of two different face centred cubic (fcc) phases along with $\sigma$ phase. With increase in the CNT amount (till 2 wt.{\%}), a gradual decrease in the volume fraction of one of the fcc phase occurred leading to microstructural homogenization. Higher CNT additions (3, 5 and 7 wt.{\%}) led to re-evolution of inhomogeneous microstructure containing chromium carbide phase and the two different fcc phases. Corrosion behaviour measurements showed that with continued addition of CNTs, reduction in the corrosion rate happened till 2wt.{\%} CNT. Beyond this, a significant enhancement in the corrosion rate was noticed for pellets with 3, 5 and 7 wt.{\%} CNT additions. Between the pristine HEA pellet and the pellet with optimum CNT amount (2 wt.{\%}), 88.6 {\%} reduction in the corrosion rate was measured. The enhancement in the corrosion resistance was attributed to an increase in the chemical homogeneity, which reduced the possibility of galvanic coupling. The decrease in the corrosion resistance beyond the optimum CNT (2 wt.{\%}) was attributed to the re-appearance of chemical heterogeneity and evolution of chromium carbide (Cr23C6) phase, which causes intergranular corrosion in these systems.},
