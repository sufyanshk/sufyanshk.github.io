abstract = {Present work studies 126 quaternary and 126 quinary equiatomic refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs), made from Group IV (Ti, Zr, Hf), Group V (V, Nb, Ta) and Group VI (Cr, Mo, W) elements. Rule-of-mixtures (ROM) technique is used to calculate liquidus temperature, density ($\rho$), Young's modulus (E), {\%} atomic size difference ($\delta$), valence electron concentration (VEC) and specific heat at constant pressure and at 1273 K (Cp). CALPHAD technique is used to predict the number of phases formed at 298 K, $\rho$ and liquidus temperature. ROM calculated densities are matching perfectly with CALPHAD values. Densities and E are directly proportional to the VEC and liquidus temperature of the alloys. Ti, Zr, Hf are ductilizing the alloys and making them light; whereas Cr, Mo and W, are reducing the alloys' ductility and making them heavy. For quinary RHEAs, Cp shows six distinct groups with $\delta$, but a similar trend is not observed in quaternary RHEAs. A methodology is developed to screen a large number of alloys based on various properties. Correlations between those properties are also studied.},

@article{Singh2020,
abstract = {FeCoCrNiCu high entropy alloy (HEA) powder was produced by mechanical alloying. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) were mixed in the HEA powder (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 wt.{\%} of CNT) and then the mixture was consolidated by spark plasma sintering at 800Â°C. Phase constitution of the pellets was sensitive to the CNT amount. With smaller quantities of CNTs (upto 2 wt.{\%}), the pellets contained a mixture of two different face centred cubic (fcc) phases along with $\sigma$ phase. With increase in the CNT amount (till 2 wt.{\%}), a gradual decrease in the volume fraction of one of the fcc phase occurred leading to microstructural homogenization. Higher CNT additions (3, 5 and 7 wt.{\%}) led to re-evolution of inhomogeneous microstructure containing chromium carbide phase and the two different fcc phases. Corrosion behaviour measurements showed that with continued addition of CNTs, reduction in the corrosion rate happened till 2wt.{\%} CNT. Beyond this, a significant enhancement in the corrosion rate was noticed for pellets with 3, 5 and 7 wt.{\%} CNT additions. Between the pristine HEA pellet and the pellet with optimum CNT amount (2 wt.{\%}), 88.6 {\%} reduction in the corrosion rate was measured. The enhancement in the corrosion resistance was attributed to an increase in the chemical homogeneity, which reduced the possibility of galvanic coupling. The decrease in the corrosion resistance beyond the optimum CNT (2 wt.{\%}) was attributed to the re-appearance of chemical heterogeneity and evolution of chromium carbide (Cr23C6) phase, which causes intergranular corrosion in these systems.},
