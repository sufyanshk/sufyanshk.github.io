The discussion below is taken from my publication<d-cite key="Shaikh2023a"></d-cite>:

The stability of an alloy (solid solution) is dictated by the Gibbs energy of its constituent phases as,
<p>$$ \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S $$</p>
<p>$$ \Delta G = \Delta E_f + {\Delta(PV)} - T\{\Delta S_{config} + \Delta S_{vib} + \Delta S_{mag} + \Delta S_{elec}\} $$</p>
where $$\Delta E_f$$ is the enthalpy of formation at 0K, $$\Delta(PV)$$ is the pressure-volume term, $$\Delta S_{config}$$ is the configurational entropy, $$\Delta S_{vib}$$ is the vibrational entropy, $$\Delta S_{mag}$$ is the magnetic entropy, and $$\Delta S_{elec}$$ is the electronic entropy. The $$\Delta(PV)$$ term can be ignored. Therefore the equation becomes,
<p>$$	\Delta G = \Delta E_f - T\Delta S_{config} - T\{\Delta S_{vib} + \Delta S_{mag} + \Delta S_{elec}\} $$</p>

Our focus in present work is to understand how much $$\Delta S_{vib}$$ is contributing to the overall $$\Delta S$$. We found that contrary to the long held notion that the $$\Delta S_{config}$$ is the primary reason for calling "High Entropy Alloy" as "High Entropy", it is the $$\Delta S_{vib}$$ which is contributing majorly to the overall entropy in concetrated alloys. We observed this after studying the absolute entropy $$S$$ and the difference of entropy $$\Delta S$$ of alloy with its constituent elements.
