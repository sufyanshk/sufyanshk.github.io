Developing ductile refractory alloys has remained a challenge due to various design parameters put forth by different researchers to understand the intrinsic ductility of BCC alloys. Here I am focusing on the intrinsic ductility parameter (D) to develop concentrated refractory alloys.

The intrinsic ductility is a ratio of surface energy (\(\gamma_s\)) and unstable stacking fault energy (\(\gamma_{usfe}\)). Accurate calculation of D requires an accurate estimate of \(\gamma_s\) and \(\gamma_{usfe}\). 

This work aims to optimally reduce the number of alloys studied as we move from binaries to ternaries to higher-order alloy systems, as depicted in the figure below.

The alloy development funnel ensures that the compositional explosion does not take place as we move from binaries to ternaries to higher-order alloy systems. What criteria to be selected to filter out alloy candidates is an integral part of my PhD dissertation. Every stage in the above funnel reduces the number of alloys to be studied based on specific property expectations criteria.

This is ongoing work; hence this page will be updated periodically.
