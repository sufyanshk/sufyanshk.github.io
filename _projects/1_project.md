Developing ductile refractory alloys have remained a challenge due to variety of design parameters put forth by various researchers. Here I am focusing on the intrinsic ductility parameter (D) to develope refractory concenterated alloys.

The intrinsic ductility is a ratio of surface energy \(γ_s\) and unstable stacking fault energy \(γ_usfe\). Accurate calculation of D requires accurate calculation of\(\gamma_s\) and \(\gamma_{usfe}\).

This is an ongoing work hence this page will be updated periodically.
