Hi! Welcome to my website.

I would be happy to present my PhD work to your team and discuss how to leverage Materials Modeling in Discovering, Designing, and Developing Advanced Alloys for some of the most challenging applications.

I have Bacherlors (COEP), Masters (IIT Madras), and PhD (IIT Madras) in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. I developed alloys for high-temperature structural applications using Ab-initio Atomistic Modeling for my PhD. I developed a refractory metal based alternative to superalloy using First-principles Atomistic Modeling that can have better high-temperature properties than the current state-of-the art Ni-based superalloys. My PhD thesis was on understanding the effect of alloying elements on the deformation and strengthening behavior of refractory metal alloys. My thesis advisors were <a rel="nofollow" href="https://mme.iitm.ac.in/murty/bsmurty">Prof. B. S. Murty</a> (Director - Indian Insitute of Technology Hyderabad) and <a rel="nofollow"  href="https://mme.iitm.ac.in/satyesh/index.html">Prof. Satyesh K. Yadav</a> (Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Madras).

I have extensive experience in various Computational Materials Engineering tools such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vasp.at">Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package</a> (Density Functional Theory/ab-initio Atomistic Modeling), <a rel="nofollow" href="https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/download.html">VESTA</a> (atomic structure visualization), <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/avdw/atat/">ATAT</a> (for special quasi-random structure generation), and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr">Atomsk</a> (atomic structure file manipulation) to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin">Digital Twin</a> of microstructural phases of metals and alloys. I enjoy automating routine tasks using Shell scripting/programming, which saves time and effort.

**My research has been recognized through 6 peer-reviewed <a href="/publications/">publications</a> (a few more are in the pipeline), 1 National Scholarship Award, 1 International Scholarship Award at Sweden, 2 Poster Presentation Awards, 3 <a href="/cv/">Govt. of India Awards</a>, 6 International Conference Presentations, and 1 <a href="/projects/3_project/">US Air Force Research Lab report</a>.** I am a proponent of **Physics-guided, Data-driven Materials Discovery, Design, and Development.** I have extensive experience in R&D Project Management, Physical Metallurgy, Failure Investigations, and Process-Structure-Property-Performance analysis using Advanced Metallography, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). I am a practitioner of First-principles Thinking and Problem Solving.

I did my Bachelors in Metallurgical Engineering from COEP Technological University (previously known as Government College of Engineering Pune-COEP), Maharshtra, India in 2015, where I was awarded the **Government of India - Ministry of Steel Scholarship of ₹120,000 (0.12 Million Indian Rupees) for academic excellence.**

I have 8 years of diverse experience in Problem-solving, Stakeholder engagement through active collaborations, <a href="/projects/">R&D Project Management</a>, Team Management, Industrial & Academic Research, and Cross-functional Collaborations. I am experienced in solving business problems using the First-principles approach by discussing complex ideas in simple terms with Customers, Suppliers, Internal Teams, and Executive Management.

Before joining IIT Madras, I was heading the Materials Lab at Bekaert India Technical Centre in Pune, Maharashtra, India. At Bekaert, I led a team of 4 Microscopists and Metallographers in the Metallurgical Investigations of tire cords, circlips, automotive springs, and wire rods using Advanced Metallography and Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). I have been trained in steel wire microstructural analysis at Bekaert’s global R&D headquarters in Belgium and Asian R&D headquarters in China. I have also been trained in the wire drawing and welding processes in India, Czech Republic, and Indonesia. My internal customer portfolio included Bekaert’s manufacturing plants and R&D teams from India, USA, Europe, Indonesia, Brazil, and Malaysia.

During my time at Bekaert, I successfully renewed the IATF 16949 certification of the Materials Lab, led more than 52 materials investigations, managed a lab with an annual budget of about INR 2.2 million, worked on cross-functional projects with teams from 5 countries, and led a team of 4 analysts. My frequent interactions with the Indian Steelmakers/Suppliers, Customers, Product Development teams, Purchase Teams, and my international counterparts from 5 countries have improved my Communication & Presentation skills, Problem-solving skills, and Persuasion skills.

I believe the next revolution in Materials Development will happen at the confluence of Physics, Computer Science, and Materials Science & Engineering, with Materials Informatics and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.awsar-dst.in/2020/winner_article_2020_view/view/Mr_Sufyan_M_Shaikh.pdf">Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME)</a> accelerating the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://iit-techambit.in/computational-materials-science/">Materials Development cycles</a>.

I enjoy reading Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead", writing poetry, and listening to music in English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil and Urdu during my free time.

I would be happy to present my work to your team and discuss how to leverage Materials Modeling in Discovering, Designing, and Developing Advanced Alloys for some of the most challenging applications.
