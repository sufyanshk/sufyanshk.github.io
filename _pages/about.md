Hi! Welcome to my website.
**I am submitting my PhD Thesis and ctively seeking a new job opportunity. Let me know if you have any opportunity.**

I am a PhD Research Scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), Tamil Nadu, India, where I am developing alloys for high-temperature structural applications using ab-initio atomistic modeling. My PhD thesis is on understanding the effect of alloying elements on the deformation and strengthening behavior of refractory metal alloys. My thesis advisors are <a href="https://mme.iitm.ac.in/murty/bsmurty">Prof. B. S. Murty</a> (Director - Indian Insitute of Technology Hyderabad) and <a href="https://mme.iitm.ac.in/satyesh/index.html">Prof. Satyesh K. Yadav</a> (Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Madras).

For my PhD, I extensively use various Computational Materials Engineering tools such as <a href="https://vasp.at">Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package</a> (Density Functional Theory/ab-initio Atomistic Modeling), <a href="https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/download.html">VESTA</a> (atomic structure visualization), <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/avdw/atat/">ATAT</a> (for special quasi-random structure generation), and <a href="https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr">Atomsk</a> (atomic structure file manipulation) to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin">Digital Twin</a> of microstructural phases of metals and alloys. I enjoy automating routine tasks using Shell scripting/programming, which saves time and effort.

**My research has been recognized through 4 peer-reviewed publications (a few more are in the pipeline), 1 Scholarship Award, 2 Poster Presentation Awards, 3 Govt. of India Awards, 5 International Conference Presentations, and 1 US Air Force Research Lab report.** I am a proponent of **Physics-guided Data-driven Materials Discovery, Design, and Development.** I have extensive experience in Project Management, Physical Metallurgy, Failure Investigations, and Process-Structure-Property-Performance analysis using Advanced Metallography & Scanning Electron Microscopy. I am a practitioner of First-principles Thinking and Problem Solving.

I did my Bachelors in Metallurgical Engineering from COEP Technological University (previously known as Government College of Engineering Pune-COEP), Maharshtra, India in 2015, where I was awarded the **Government of India - Ministry of Steel Scholarship of ₹120,000 (0.12 Million Indian Rupees) for academic excellence.**

I have 7+ years of diverse experience in Project Management, Team Management, Industrial & Academic Research, and Cross-functional Collaborations. I like solving business problems using the First-principles approach by discussing complex ideas in simple terms with Customers, Suppliers, Internal Teams, and Executive Management.

Before joining IIT Madras, I was heading the Materials Lab at <a href="https://www.bekaert.com/en/about-us">Bekaert</a> India Technical Centre in Pune, Maharashtra, India. At Bekaert, I led a team of 4 microscopists and metallographers in the metallurgical characterization of tire cords, circlips, automotive springs, and wire rods using Advanced Metallography and Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). I have been trained in steel wire microstructural analysis at Bekaert’s global R&D headquarters in Belgium and Asian R&D headquarters in China. I have also been trained in the wire drawing process in India, Czech Republic, and Indonesia. My internal customer portfolio included Bekaert’s manufacturing plants and R&D teams from India, USA, Europe, Indonesia, Brazil, and Malaysia.

During my time at Bekaert, I successfully renewed the IATF 16949 certification of the Materials Lab, led more than 52 materials investigations, managed a lab with an annual budget of about INR 2.2 million, worked on cross-functional projects with teams from 5 countries, and led a team of 4 analysts. My frequent interactions with the Indian Steelmakers/Suppliers, Customers, Product Development teams, Purchase Teams, and my international counterparts from 5 countries have improved my Communication & Presentation skills, Problem-solving skills, and Persuasion skills.

I believe the next revolution in Materials Development will happen at the confluence of Physics, Computer Science, and Materials Science & Engineering, with Materials Informatics and <a href="https://www.awsar-dst.in/2020/winner_article_2020_view/view/Mr_Sufyan_M_Shaikh.pdf">Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME)</a> accelerating the <a href="https://iit-techambit.in/computational-materials-science/">Materials Development cycles</a>.

I enjoy reading Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead", writing poetry, and listening to music in English, Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu during my downtime. **I am submitting my PhD Thesis and ctively seeking a new job opportunity. Let me know if you have any opportunity.**
